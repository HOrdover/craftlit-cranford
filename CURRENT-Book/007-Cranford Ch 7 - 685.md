## Pre-hash Notes
- **Family Tree Support through Chapter 7** 
- ![[Cranford Character Sheet.png]]
- **John Bull** - 1710s meant "typically English" bu tby 1840s stared to mean "Anglomaniacs"  
- **Queen Adelaid**e - Wife of William IV who reigned 1830-37
- **Condescendingly** - like in Emma, not an insult "Middle English (in the sense ‘give way, defer’):" now means be patronizing
- **Tyrrell** - William Tyrrell is said to have murdered King William (Rufus) II, the oppressive son of William I around 1100CE. Sir James Tyrrell was allegedly the man who (at the instigation of Richard III - who imprisoned the young Edward V and his bro Richard, Duke of York in the Tower) murdered the two boys; he was beheaded in 1502. This Tyrrell came from a family in Suffolk, said to be the descendents of the earlier Walter. 
- **Bombazine** - a [twilled](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=6f4cffb8fcc6cffb&sxsrf=AHTn8zpeH-qtUvTmVcfabrQiL1-3_03j9Q:1746549176281&q=twilled&si=APYL9btezPaTUY7KecSEHRUsL7yctqYWDbxQV3mq_IJPnC7X8VGJjo4z221YVQRJzx3DHhutqH5BwyHbtXmZ3QyHv1o2Xvsufg87QKBsLvay1Y3WwV4kpyY%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjNs_DZoo-NAxXpMVkFHa75LvsQyecJegQILRAR) dress fabric of [worsted](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=6f4cffb8fcc6cffb&sxsrf=AHTn8zpeH-qtUvTmVcfabrQiL1-3_03j9Q:1746549176281&q=worsted&si=APYL9btezPaTUY7KecSEHRUsL7ycQA1EyGN-_L9VZE7ALX569m-VNn2wTu05KzCVCgwjtBsfagMkfdlZua2EytvePav57iZwlk3rLwqr4T83v1ty_epvvBQ%3D&expnd=1&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjNs_DZoo-NAxXpMVkFHa75LvsQyecJegQILRAS) and silk or cotton - black bombazine was classic for mouring clothes
- **Calache** - again - but this time with a little more info
- **Seed cake** - scented soap--"==No, seed cake does not typically taste like soap==. Seed cake is a plain sponge cake flavored with caraway seeds, and sometimes mixed peel. Its flavor is described as subtly fragrant and delicate. The taste of seed cake is primarily influenced by the caraway seeds and any other added flavorings, not by a soapy taste."
- **Archdeacons** are next in rank to a bishop - and the superintendent to the clergy in a diocese
- **Damson tart** - recipes please (and [a fun way to use leftover damsons from gin making!](https://damsondays.com/damson-port-the-most-delicious-way-to-use-left-over-damsons-from-gin-making/))
