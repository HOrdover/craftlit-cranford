## Pre-hash Notes
Chapter 4: A Visit to an Old Bachelor
- Miss Matty and friends visit Mr. Holbrook’s farm, rekindling old feelings. Shortly after, Mr. Holbrook falls ill and dies.
- Miss Matilda SATE bolt upright (not a typo)
- Pinks and ***gilly***-flowers
- Poet George Herbert—EUAN TO RECORD
- Turkey carpet - Turkish carpet
- Flag floor - flagstone floor
- Pudding before meat and “no broth no ball; no ball, no beef” - eat something to take the edge off before you get to the most expensive part of the meal—the meat, a “ball” would have been a suet dumpling which was, apparently, a Yorkshire-area “old way” but I’m going to defer to listeners who know better.
- Old fashioned forks - like 16th Century/1500s - were two-tine forks. Think hand-sized, long prongs like a small meat stabbity thing. By 1800 most of these had been replaced by four-prong forks.
- “Aminé at her grains of rice after her previous feast with the Ghoul” - Arabian Nights (1765-8) Aminé is wife of Sidi Norman who notices she only eats rice with a bodkin. He figures out she’s a Ghoul who goes to cemeteries at night to feast on the newly-buried dead so rice was pretty ‘meh’ for her. **CHECK ON THIS**
- “Unbecoming [***calashes***](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/116425) to put on over their caps” - threw me b/c of the Caleche’s in Dracula - turns out they’re related! Retractable hood to put over a cap! PICTURE TO SHARE
- Some Tennyson will pop up - a line about cedars from 1842’s “The Gardiner’s Daughter” and in the original text the line before the one about the cedars appeared talking about the color of ASHBUDS ”black as ashbuds”- It’s missing from the published version so a conversation turn would have been less of an utter non-sequiter in the OG version.
- There will be a marvelous joke line for the crocheters in our midst. These are the reasons I love EG so much
- “Locksley Hall” by Tennyson - a lover revisits the place where he fell in love with a woman who was forced to marry someone else. So - not included accidentally.
- Visiting rules - it would be Making A Statement for a gentleman to call on a lady directly…or at least it would when the lady were younger. This is part of why Capt Brown’s visits flustered Miss Jenkyns

## Post-chapter Notes
- “My cousin might make a drive, I think,” said Miss Pole, who was afraid of ear-ache, and had only her cap on— spectacular set of non-sequiters (p41)
- 26 cows named after letters of the alphabet. Gaskell has a thing for quirky cows? <3 
- LOVE Mary Smith’s description of Mr Holbrook in the garden Bierrrron and Go-ëthee pronunciations and his joyful connection of garden and poetry - but the best is his sitting room strewn with books chosen for his pleasure not for the classical or established reputations. <3
- I saw, I imitated, I survived - Mary Smith as Cæsar - using rounded knife tip as a spoon-ish food delivery device
- I had NO IDEA it would have been an honor to fill a man’s pipe!!!!?!
- “I only hope it is not improper; so many pleasant things are” and “Uncouth is too hard a word. I should call him eccentric; very clever people always are!” - GOD I love Miss Marty.
- LOVE Mr Hollbrook’s Black as ashbuds thing - and how he never knew and is proud of never knowing/learning from a poet.
- Miss pole encouraged poetry reading so she could count her stitches :D 
- I love the Hollbrook’s actions “flutter” Miss Matty - not FLUSTER. <3 
- “I don’t believe frogs will agree with him” HA!!!! And “he used to have to be careful about what he ate” shows more knowledge of each other than she’d betrayed before.
- We learn that Martha may not have known how to serve at table, but she DOES know how to read and write - she writes a few lines to Mary Smith to keep her up to date on Miss Matty.
- “Wicked Paris where they are always having revolutions” HA!
- TWO chapters where love conquers - Miss Jenkyns “the most proper place for his arm to be!” With Miss Jessie— and here, Miss Matty and Martha “God forbid that I should grieve any young hearts.”

## Miscellaneous
Thin Man Movie night at end of May - start of Moby Dick start of May?

POEM REQUEST TO EUAN
So, if Euan is really a glutton for punishment, I’d be thrilled to have him do Moby Dick. I’d be starting in Early May and probably do the first four chapters for the first episode. He should read/listen to those first (Free on Librivox.org) and see if he wants to attack the various voices/situations. There are some truly hilarious bits in there and, in fact, the last few paragraphs of chapter 3 convinced Aaron to read. I’ll share the quote here in a sec for you to see, too.

However, where I really need help sooner is with some short bits of English poetry I’ve never heard of:

George Herbert’s poetry often draws on the natural world, gardens, and quiet reflection:
1. “The Flower”

Theme: Renewal, the seasons of the soul, joy in growth
Perfect for July because: It celebrates the resurgence of beauty and hope—after cold or darkness, flowers bloom again.

	“Grief melts away
Like snow in May,
As if there were no such cold thing.”

	“Who would have thought my shriveled heart
Could have recovered greenness? It was gone
Quite underground; as flowers depart
To see their mother-root, when they have blown.”

	“Thy garden is not bare;
And I shall find once more
The sweet communion with thy saints.”

2. “Easter”

Yes, it’s tied to the holiday, but it also celebrates light and blooming.

	“Rise heart; thy Lord is risen. Sing his praise
Without delays,
Who takes thee by the hand, that thou likewise
With him mayst rise.”

Pair this with literal rising things—morning sun, lilies, tall foxgloves.

3. “The Pulley”

Theme: Why God withholds perfect rest—so we seek Him.
This works well in summer, when life feels abundant, but still leaves a twinge of longing.

	“When God at first made man,
Having a glass of blessings standing by…”
(and yet withheld rest, to draw man’s soul back to God)

A beautiful idea for a reflective pause among too-perfect blooms.

4. “Love (III)”

Theme: Divine love, human unworthiness, and acceptance
It’s more theological, but gentle and moving—great for a quiet bench moment in a shady corner.

	“Love bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back…”
“You must sit down,” says Love, “and taste my meat.”
So I did sit and eat.”

It pairs beautifully with the hum of bees and the hospitality of a garden.

If you want a very short quote for your garden journal or bench-musing:
	•	“Thou hast given me this herb of grace to smell and taste.” — from “Grace”
	•	“Sweet rose, whose hue angry and brave…” — from “Virtue”
	•	“He that in mirth and youthful jollity keeps measure, is more temperate than he that lets his sorrow flow out without check.” — from his prose The Country Parson
