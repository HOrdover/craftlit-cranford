## Poem selections
George Herbert’s poetry often draws on the natural world, gardens, and quiet reflection:
1. “The Flower”

Theme: Renewal, the seasons of the soul, joy in growth
Perfect for July because: It celebrates the resurgence of beauty and hope—after cold or darkness, flowers bloom again.

	“Grief melts away
Like snow in May,
As if there were no such cold thing.”

	“Who would have thought my shriveled heart
Could have recovered greenness? It was gone
Quite underground; as flowers depart
To see their mother-root, when they have blown.”

	“Thy garden is not bare;
And I shall find once more
The sweet communion with thy saints.”

2. “Easter”

Yes, it’s tied to the holiday, but it also celebrates light and blooming.

	“Rise heart; thy Lord is risen. Sing his praise
Without delays,
Who takes thee by the hand, that thou likewise
With him mayst rise.”

Pair this with literal rising things—morning sun, lilies, tall foxgloves.

3. “The Pulley”

Theme: Why God withholds perfect rest—so we seek Him.
This works well in summer, when life feels abundant, but still leaves a twinge of longing.

	“When God at first made man,
Having a glass of blessings standing by…”
(and yet withheld rest, to draw man’s soul back to God)

A beautiful idea for a reflective pause among too-perfect blooms.

4. “Love (III)”

Theme: Divine love, human unworthiness, and acceptance
It’s more theological, but gentle and moving—great for a quiet bench moment in a shady corner.

	“Love bade me welcome; yet my soul drew back…”
“You must sit down,” says Love, “and taste my meat.”
So I did sit and eat.”

It pairs beautifully with the hum of bees and the hospitality of a garden.

If you want a very short quote for your garden journal or bench-musing:
	•	“Thou hast given me this herb of grace to smell and taste.” — from “Grace”
	•	“Sweet rose, whose hue angry and brave…” — from “Virtue”
	•	“He that in mirth and youthful jollity keeps measure, is more temperate than he that lets his sorrow flow out without check.” — from his prose The Country Parson
