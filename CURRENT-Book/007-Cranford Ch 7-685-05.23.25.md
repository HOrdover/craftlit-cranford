- **Tyrrell** - William Tyrrell is said to have murdered King William (Rufus) II, the oppressive son of William I around 1100CE. Sir James Tyrrell was allegedly the man who (at the instigation of Richard III - who imprisoned the young Edward V and his bro Richard, Duke of York in the Tower) murdered the two boys; he was beheaded in 1502. This Tyrrell came from a family in Suffolk, said to be the descendents of the earlier Walter. ![Sir James Tyrell (d.1502)](https://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/tyrell-princes.jpg)
