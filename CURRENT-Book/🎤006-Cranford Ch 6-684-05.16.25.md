## BOOK TALK‚ÄîRe-hash Ch5 Notes
13:40 Read all the letters and ended with "poor Peter" which will be where we begin today

## Pre-hash Ch6 Notes
- 15:30 **Reminder From Ch 5:** Bonus Bernardus non video omnia* The Blessed Bernard does not see everything - maybe said by St Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153)‚Äî This quote is often attributed (possibly apocryphally) to **Peter Abelard**, the 12th-century theologian, as a **gentle jab at St. Bernard of Clairvaux**, with whom he clashed theologically.
	**Meaning:**
		Even the wisest man (here, _Blessed Bernard_) can be wrong sometimes.  
- 16:00 **Hoaxing** - slang when it first came in to use 1796 but by 1820 it was common use. So by 1840-50 it was no longer improper to use.
- 16:44 ***St James‚Äôs Chronicle*** - [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/sn88088600/) 
- 18:00 **Rhododendron** - in late 1840s and in to the 1850s, Botanist Sir Joseph Hooker bro und exotic species back from the Himalayas which was VERY exciting and the reason that the Rhododendron Dell was put in at Kew Gardens‚Ä¶ IS IT STILL THERE? heather@craftlit.com or 1-206-350-1642, or speakpipe.com/craftlit
- 20:10 **Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus** - [ONLY BOOK THAT DOESN'T MENTION GOD ](https://youtu.be/JydNSlufRIs?si=E_LmB-PmPa6-qrqa)        ==BTW ERIK - if you wanted to have fun, after the first time I mention Haman, you can overlap [the sound of the grogger](https://youtu.be/9Ds8A-TmvV0?si=pe_ylejCLdBvaQjP)  a bit so people can JUST make out that it's Haman being named, but also hear the grogger sound (which I think I mention...23:25, and 24:11, and 24:23) this is also a [link to a pic of a Torah scroll](https://blog.stephens.edu/arh101glossary/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/torahscroll.jpg) to put on screen at 21:05. The Megilla scroll of the Book of Esther, you can put on screen whenever it's appropriate and also in the shownotes.==
- ![Of Justice and Consensus: the lessons of Megillat Esther](https://www.yaelshahar.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Megillah1.png)      
- LOOK! ‚¨ÜÔ∏è It's a Whole Megillah! üòÇ
- 26:00 **No overland route for Poor Peter** - this clues us in on when Peter went to India. [An overland route via the Red Sea was opened in the late 1830s](https://englishhistoryauthors.blogspot.com/2017/06/full-steam-ahead-overland-route-home.html. ==Erik, if you can pull an on-screen pic from this website, nifty. If not, no worries==
- ==26:45 FOR VIDEO - SHAWL IN LOWER LEFT and as backdrops seen through lousy reflections in glass case--pic taken by me at the Elizabeth Gaskell House in 2015==![[45959C3B-6693-44E2-8A38-2D8240D8B877_1_105_c.jpeg]]
- 27:30 **‚ÄúSome Great War in India‚Äù** - probably the [First Anglo Burmese War (1824-26)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Anglo-Burmese_War)
- 28:54 here's your chapter summary: **Summary:**  Miss Matty shares the story of her brother, Peter, who left Cranford after a disagreement with their father. His absence left a lasting impact on Miss Matty, highlighting the deep bonds of family despite misunderstandings.


29:21CHAPTER AUDIO STARTS
==ERIK - can you check around 13:10 in this **chapter's** audio? - I think Noel Badrian repeats a sentence. If I'm right, use his second take. --**THANK YOU FOR FIXING THAT!!!!**==

==ERIK -- this is going to be so obnoxious - can you rotate all the crafty videos I record at the desk? It's going to drive some folks nuts that I've recorded "upside down" - it's the only way I can get the tripod in shape. :()


## Post-chapter Notes
- 01:02:29 "Jack and Jilling it" is shorthand for when Heather refers to this article: ***Journal of Reading***, Volume 24, No. 2, November 1980, p. 101, William H. Smith, "What they didn't tell you about Jack and Jill"
