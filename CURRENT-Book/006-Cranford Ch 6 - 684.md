Then I found that I'd watched several of her videos on the subject of Individualism:
- [Toxic Individualism #1](https://youtu.be/tt3GwF7J-yc?si=sjOkDkWmEFLRVWf0)
- [Toxic Individualism #2](https://youtu.be/gyt59o9Etok?si=x3heRzFCUWoTqAaW&t=84)
Rugged Individualism (and another video on the [same topic from Robert Reich](https://youtu.be/0Rzn6GZxsF0?si=6zeQpEpbMgZNeF_g))
[Bug and Bee house](https://youtu.be/MouCp0sacFw?si=BG6CnfRgr7xSdSVu) (I love this guy's VERY DIY attitude) and [Ladybug Hotel #1](https://youtu.be/NQQFT2xgOvU?si=hvvkI0d2aZT18Vsi) and [Ladybug Hotel #2](https://youtu.be/y1rurWP8ydE?si=9NcVAsGWi7wmd9vm)

## BOOK TALK‚ÄîRe-hash Notes
Read all the letters and ended with "poor Peter" which will be where we begin today

## Pre-hash Notes
- **Reminder From Ch 5:** Bonus Bernardus non video omnia* The Blessed Bernard does not see everything - maybe said by St Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153)‚Äî This quote is often attributed (possibly apocryphally) to **Peter Abelard**, the 12th-century theologian, as a **gentle jab at St. Bernard of Clairvaux**, with whom he clashed theologically.
	**Meaning:**
		Even the wisest man (here, _Blessed Bernard_) can be wrong sometimes.  
- **Hoaxing** - slang when it first came in to use 1796 but by 1820 it was common use. So by 1840-50 it was no longer improper to use.
- ***St James‚Äôs Chronicle*** - [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/sn88088600/) 
- **Rhododendron** - in late 1840s and in to the 1850s, Botanist Sir Joseph Hooker bro und exotic species back from the Himalayas which was VERY exciting and the reason that the Rhododendron Dell was put in at Kew Gardens‚Ä¶ IS IT STILL THERE? heather@craftlit.com or 1-206-350-1642, or speakpipe.com/craftlit
- ***"Lilies of the field"***, allusion to Matthew 6:28-29
- **Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus** - [ONLY BOOK THAT DOESN'T MENTION GOD ](https://youtu.be/JydNSlufRIs?si=E_LmB-PmPa6-qrqa) King/Queen Vashti, new wife (Esther hid her Jewishness), her Uncle Mordachi helps save King's life, and Haman (boooo) is behind that. Lots of drunken rages. The King listened to Esther (Yayyy!). ==BTW - if you wanted to have fun, after the first time I mention Haman, you can overlap [the sound of the grogger](https://youtu.be/9Ds8A-TmvV0?si=pe_ylejCLdBvaQjP)  a bit so people can JUST make out that it's Haman being named, but also hear the grogger sound (which I think I mention...)==
- ![Of Justice and Consensus: the lessons of Megillat Esther](https://www.yaelshahar.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Megillah1.png)      
- LOOK! ‚¨ÜÔ∏è It's a Whole Megillah! üòÇ
- **No overland route for Poor Peter** - this clues us in on when Peter went to India. [An overland route via the Red Sea was opened in the late 1830s](https://englishhistoryauthors.blogspot.com/2017/06/full-steam-ahead-overland-route-home.html.
- **Soft white India shawl** - that's probably yummy Cashmere! Just like the scene that opens N&S
- **‚ÄúSome Great War in India‚Äù** - probably the [First Anglo Burmese War (1824-26)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Anglo-Burmese_War) 

==ERIK - can you check around 13:10 in this chapter's audio? - I think Noel Badrian repeats a sentence. If I'm right, use his second take.==
