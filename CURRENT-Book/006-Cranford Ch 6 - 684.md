Then I found that I'd watched several of her videos on the subject of Individualism:
- [Toxic Individualism #1](https://youtu.be/tt3GwF7J-yc?si=sjOkDkWmEFLRVWf0)
- [Toxic Individualism #2](https://youtu.be/gyt59o9Etok?si=x3heRzFCUWoTqAaW&t=84)
Rugged Individualism (and another video on the [same topic from Robert Reich](https://youtu.be/0Rzn6GZxsF0?si=6zeQpEpbMgZNeF_g))

## BOOK TALK—Re-hash Notes
Read all the letters and ended with "poor Peter" which will be where we begin today

## Pre-hash Notes
- **Reminder From Ch 5:** Bonus Bernardus non video omnia* The Blessed Bernard does not see everything - maybe said by St Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153)— This quote is often attributed (possibly apocryphally) to **Peter Abelard**, the 12th-century theologian, as a **gentle jab at St. Bernard of Clairvaux**, with whom he clashed theologically.
	**Meaning:**
		Even the wisest man (here, _Blessed Bernard_) can be wrong sometimes.  
- **Hoaxing** - slang when it first came in to use 1796 but by 1820 it was common use. So by 1840-50 it was no longer improper to use.
- ***St James’s Chronicle*** - [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/sn88088600/) 
- **Rhododendron** - in late 1840s and in to the 1850s, Botanist Sir Joseph Hooker bro und exotic species back from the Himalayas which was VERY exciting and the reason that the Rhododendron Dell was put in at Kew Gardens… IS IT STILL THERE? heather@craftlit.com or 1-206-350-1642, or speakpipe.com/craftlit
- ***"Lilies of the field"***, allusion to Matthew 6:28-29
- **Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus** - [ONLY BOOK THAT DOESN'T MENTION GOD ](https://youtu.be/JydNSlufRIs?si=E_LmB-PmPa6-qrqa) King/Queen Vashti, new wife (Esther hid her Jewishness), her Uncle Mordachi helps save King's life, and Haman (boooo) is behind that. Lots of drunken rages. The King listened to Esther. Also the source of The Whole Megillah. Haman's Dice *Pur* (pur-im)
- **Dor** - maybe abbreviation of Deborah?
- **No overland route** - this clues us in on when Peter went to India. An overland route via the Red Sea was opened in the late 1830s, while Ships had to go down and round the Cape of Good Hope until the Suez Canal was opened in 1869.
- **Soft white India shawl** - that's probably yummy Cashmere! Just like the scene that opens N&S
- **“Some Great War in India”** - probably the First Burmese War (1824-26) when Britain declared war on Burma, which had threatened territory in India.
- TRIGGER WARNING

==ERIK - can you check around 13:10 in this chapter - I think Noel Badrian repeats a sentence. If I'm right, use the second take.==
## Post-chapter Notes
Gaskell's brother was like Peter in as far as going to India. John Stevenson was born 1798 (EG was born ______) He became a sailor, went to India for the first time in 1825 and wrote often, then in 1828 he went back to live there. It's unclear if he died on the voyage or in India but she never heard from him again.
LOVE that Miss Matty sends martha out and locks doors before telling story

## Miscellaneous
Re: Ch 2 they had to “send Captain Brown to Coventry.”
- The expression probably dates back to the English Civil War (1640s):
    •    Royalist prisoners of war (supporters of King Charles I) were sent to the strongly Parliamentarian town of Coventry, where the local citizens were ordered not to speak to them.
    •    Coventry thus became associated with isolation and silent treatment.
- Another (less formal) theory is:
    •    Coventry was seen as a place far away from polite London society — so being “sent to Coventry” meant being socially exiled.
**And Alix added:**
Wikipedia reminded me that France has its own geographical word of social punishment :  “A partial French equivalent is limoger (removing or demoting someone from a high position), which is derived from Limoges, the city in central France to which generals deemed incompetent were sent during World War I.”
And
I wasn’t familiar with this one!
