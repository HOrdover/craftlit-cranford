We said it as kids, but maybe because my mother is English?  I never hear it now.  

Wikipedia reminded me that France has its own geographical word of social punishment :  “A partial French equivalent is limoger (removing or demoting someone from a high position), which is derived from Limoges, the city in central France to which generals deemed incompetent were sent during World War I.”
And
I wasn’t familiar with this one!

Research said:

The expression probably dates back to the English Civil War (1640s):
    •    Royalist prisoners of war (supporters of King Charles I) were sent to the strongly Parliamentarian town of Coventry, where the local citizens were ordered not to speak to them.
    •    Coventry thus became associated with isolation and silent treatment.

Another (less formal) theory is:
    •    Coventry was seen as a place far away from polite London society — so being “sent to Coventry” meant being socially exiled.
