Tonight is CraftLit’s The Thin Man Book Party! If you haven’t read it yet, there’s a fun Lux Radio recording here:

and I found only one decent audiobook version of the Dashiell Hammett classic, recorded by William Dufris. My Hoopla/Libby didn’t carry it but maybe yours will. 
Need to level up for the party?
