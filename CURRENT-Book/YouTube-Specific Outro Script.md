**[OUTRO SCRIPT – CRAFTLIT VIDEO VERSION]**

  Hey YouTube - I have a special message for you:
  
You may have noticed that we set our episodes so there are No mid-video interruptions, no “smash that like button” stuff. I know that breaks the flow—and _I_ hate it when people do that.

So here’s the deal:

If you _like_ not being harangued to like and subscribe…

…then please, like and subscribe 😄

and share it too. That’s how we get to keep making videos like this.

  

If you’re new to CraftLit and want to know how to get more books,

👉 that link’s up on screen now.

  

And if you’re curious how to support the video version specifically,

👉 there’s a different link for that too.

  

Last thing:

Audio-annotated classic books are not a sexy sell. I know.

I _hate_ feeling like a salesperson.

So here’s the most helpful thing you can do:

Pick a book. Maybe _Northanger Abbey_—it’s on YouTube, no video add-ons, easy start.

Then grab a friend or two—maybe your book club—and just listen together.

CraftLit is a great jumping-off point for real book discussion, and that helps the show more than anything else.

  

Thanks for being here.
