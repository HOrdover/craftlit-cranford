Fri 11 April
I'll add things here that I don't want us to lose track of since Slack is NOT holding up its end of the bargain.
- I added cards to Knitty.com and to the raffle video and dealt with the inevitable copyright thing on 679 for YouTube. 
- Also added the timecode for Start of Chapter Audio and Start of post-chapter chat.
- I didn't touch Patreon or Libsyn or Wordpress.
