I have been using the song "Matthew Shell_Love Part Two (Original Mix).mp3" as exit music for my free podcast back on September 22, 2007, episode 71. Mr. Shell was given credit on that episode (http://craftlit.com/71-2/) and continues to be. I downloaded the song from a PodSafe audio site at that time where the artist placed it for free podcaster useâ€”with no added restrictions or constraints. 
I contacted Mr. Shell several years ago on Instagram DMs to confirm that I have the rights to use this song. He agreed and gave me license permission. 
This link goes directly to a screenshot of my conversation with Mr Shell where he gave me rights to continue using his song as outro music: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/03i01vwuih3g7dh5yf0cq/Matthew-Shell-Approval-IG-DM.png?rlkey=4pdaq78ss7o0wcuk5u6536l8s&st=4xpwwoup&dl=0

As such, I continue to use (and to attribute) the audio under the original (18-year-old) agreement.
Thank you,
