==Erik—I'm using these for my recording notes (so I don't have to keep looking down at my papers). How do you want me to flag the items to put into the shownotes or do you think you can tell?==


# Podcast Literature Note: Cranford
### 683—PANGO!

**Date:** 2025-04-14

## Book
Cranford ==ERIK - I made notes in the Slack channel - I've really messed things up with not recording the week-of. I'm going to need to pay more attention. 
**I'm not sure how much you'll need to cut off to recalculate the book talk/post-chapter audio**. BUT I have a solution to not having to wait for me! You still have access to Descript, right? - you can [get the AI to ***regenerate*** my voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=866wu6ux_2M) with the proper time codes! Even if you just upload that little timecode file, I think it can regenerate me well enough.==

## Pre-hash Notes
19:24 START BOOK TALK
- 20:24 **Joint- Stock bank:** > A **bank owned by shareholders**, operating under a **charter** or act of Parliament, and offering services to the public. — - Unlike older private banks (run by individuals or families), joint-stock banks were **corporations**, meaning **shared risk** and more **capital**.     
	- - How bank books worked— A **bank book** (also called a **passbook**) was given to bank customers to record all transactions in their account—- Every deposit and withdrawal was manually written into the book **by a bank clerk.** The customer’s copy was **their only proof** of the account’s balance.
- 22:33 **Envelope usage** / turning inside out (ETSY doing this NOW)
	- Whole vs half sheet and crossed letters
- 25:03 **STRING** (Xmas!) and **Indian-rubber rings** history of——part of a broader trend of **Victorian technological novelty, practicality, and even fashion**.
- 26:05 “India-rubber” was the 19th-century term for what we now just call **rubber**—and India-rubber _rings_ were **small rubber loops or bands** like we use today
		- **🧪 The Material:** **India-rubber**
			- Came from the latex of tropical trees (especially _Hevea brasiliensis_).
			- It was originally used for **erasing pencil marks**—hence “rubber.”
- 28:08 **TONQUIN beans**: TONKA beans: Tonka beans are ==the wrinkled, black seeds of the Dipteryx odorata tree, native to South America==. Chefs outside the US use them in desserts and to replace nuts. AND ILLEGAL in USA since 1954 due to presence of liver damaging “coumarin” - [video on the beans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392UXLR-TWs) - and *[this video was released **just after I recorded this episode**](https://youtu.be/tgHEMFM6KY4?si=lJmaYpKvnYM9bgOA)!*

- 32:09 **PADUASOY**: heavy, rich corded or embossed silk fabric, From French - ***peau de soie***, a cloth resembling serge (twill fabric with diagonal lines/ridges on both inner and outer surfaces per a two-up/two-down weave.)
![[Pasted image 20250414101146.jpg]] 
- 33:44 **Bottom of page a small “T.O.”** = turn over / Molly’s writing is full of spelling like “Bewty” which is a subsequent joke line
- 35:14 ***Dum memor ipse Mei, dum Spiritus regift artus*** - Virgil, Æneid, IV.382, “While memory shall last and breath still control my limbs”
- 35:55 **Carmen** (lowercase) like CARMINA (song poem or verse)
- 36:20 **Gentleman’s Magazine** 1782—Kind of an Atlantic Monthly—guess who contributed? *Samuel Johnson!*
- 36:45 **M. T. Ciceroni’s Epistolae**: The letters of Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43BCE) Roman statesman, orator, philosopher, and writer with 800+ letters surviving

- 38:05 **“Rod in a pickle”** - rod, method of punishment; pickle, something preserved for future use. 
- 39:07 ***Life is a vale of tears:*** Psalm 84:6 also, description of a helicopter parent feels marvelously modern 
- 39:46 **Mrs Chapone (1727-1801)** Contributed to the Rambler AND Gentleman’s Magazine and wrote “Letters on the Improvement of the Mind (1773) and **Mrs Carter (1717-1806)** many languages and in 1758 published first translation of Epictetus *THE Stoic Philosopher*.
- 41:00 "Before Miss Edgeworth’s 'Patronage' had banished wafers from polite society...”: Patronage was a book (1814) with a character who was offended by a letter she received that was sealed with a wafer: “I wonder how any man can have the impertinence to send me his spittle” (I, 248) 
- 42:35 **“Old original post with stamp in the corner”** not exactly the right watermark, but you get the idea...![](https://nycroblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zqm-i-28-6-brittania.jpg?w=768)
- 43:55 “**Sesquipedalian**” writing - foot and a half long _sesqui_ = 1-½ pedalis =foot looonng polysyllabic words
- 44:40 **Buonaparte** (Bony)1805 invasion fears - In case you still need to build your own [BUG OUT BAG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5CitQHdGg&ab_channel=Pam%27sPOV)
- 46:23**David and Goliath**, son of Jesse (I Samuel 17)
	- **Apollyon (Greek version) and Abbadon (Hebrew version)** are names for an archangel In Revelation 9:11—> _“And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.” (_Revelation 9:11, KJV_)
			**Meaning:**
			- **Abaddon** (_Hebrew_) means **“destruction”** or **“place of destruction.”**
		    - **Apollyon** (_Greek_) means **“destroyer.”**
		    - **It’s overblown biblical satire**—calling someone “Apollyon” in _Cranford_ is like referring to a strict schoolmarm as “Beelzebub.”
- 47:30 *Bonus Bernardus non video omnia* The Blessed Bernard does not see everything - maybe said by St Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153)— This quote is often attributed (possibly apocryphally) to **Peter Abelard**, the 12th-century theologian, as a **gentle jab at St. Bernard of Clairvaux**, with whom he clashed theologically.
	**Meaning:**
		Even the wisest man (here, _Blessed Bernard_) can be wrong sometimes.

## Post-chapter Notes
- ***Chapone*** and ***Carter*** and ***Bluestockings*** (see below for big notes)
	- real historical women writers, both part of the 18th-century English Bluestocking movement—educated, literary women who promoted female intellectualism and moral development. Gaskell is absolutely name-dropping intentionally here for Cranford’s themes of domestic gentility, moral seriousness, and self-improvement.
⸻
Mrs. Chapone
Hester Chapone (1727–1801)
• Best known for ***Letters on the Improvement of the Mind*** (1773), addressed to her niece.
	• It was a conduct book for young women, offering advice on moral character, reading habits, and proper behavior.
	• Hugely popular—Cranford-adjacent readers would know her by name.
⸻
Mrs. Carter
Elizabeth Carter (1717–1806)
• A respected scholar, translator, and poet—a genuine intellectual heavyweight.
• Famously translated the ***Discourses of Epictetus*** from Greek in 1758—the first English translation by a woman, and one of the first of Epictetus ***at all***.
• She knew multiple classical and modern languages and was close friends with figures like Samuel Johnson and *Hannah More*.
