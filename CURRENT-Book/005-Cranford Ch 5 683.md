## Pre-hash Notes
Amazingly subtle Character info in today's chapter
- **Joint- Stock bank:** > A **bank owned by shareholders**, operating under a **charter** or act of Parliament, and offering services to the public. — - Unlike older private banks (run by individuals or families), joint-stock banks were **corporations**, meaning **shared risk** and more **capital**.     
	- They emerged especially **after the 1826 Banking Co-Partnership Act**, which allowed banks with more than six partners to operate **outside London**.
	- These banks were a **sign of progress and modernity**—but also **risk** and uncertainty.
- How bank books worked— A **bank book** (also called a **passbook**) was:
	- A small ledger given to bank customers to record all transactions in their account—- Every deposit and withdrawal was manually written into the book **by a bank clerk**.    
	- The customer’s copy was **their only proof** of the account’s balance.
    - If pages were **torn out**, it could mean:
        - Fraud or deception, 
	    - Loss of financial record,
        - Or simply **a ruined and invalid account book**.
- **Envelope usage** / turning inside out (ETSY doing this NOW)
	- Whole vs half sheet and crossed letters
- **STRING** (Xmas!) and **Indian-rubber rings** history of——part of a broader trend of **Victorian technological novelty, practicality, and even fashion**.—“India-rubber” was the 19th-century term for what we now just call **rubber**—and India-rubber _rings_ were:
	- **Small rubber loops or bands**, used in a variety of practical and domestic ways:
> 		to **secure rolled-up letters or documents**, **hold parcels**, or even fasten clothing items.
	They could be:
	- **Purely utilitarian** (holding papers, sealing bags),
	- Or **quasi-fashionable** (sometimes used like elastic garters, hair bands, etc.).
	- **🧪 The Material:** **India-rubber**
		- Came from the latex of tropical trees (especially _Hevea brasiliensis_).
	    - Called “India-rubber” because early Europeans believed it came from the East Indies.
	    - It was originally used for **erasing pencil marks**—hence “rubber.”
- **Define: Chary**: reluctant to do something - wary
- - Miss Matty “piqued herself on the precise neatness of all her chamber arrangements” her room was tidy enough that she didn’t need a candle to find her way around it
- **TONQUIN beans**: TONKA beans: Tonka beans are ==the wrinkled, black seeds of the Dipteryx odorata tree, native to South America==. They have a complex scent of vanilla, almond, cherry, clove, and cinnamon, and a sweet, grassy taste with a spicy aftertaste. In perfumery, tonka beans are used for their warm, sensual scent in floral, oriental, and gourmand fragrances. Chefs outside the US use them in desserts and to replace nuts. AND ILLEGAL in USA since 1954 due to presence of liver damaging “coumarin” - [video on the beans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392UXLR-TWs)
- [Full bottomed wig:](https://museums.fivecolleges.edu/detail.php?museum=&t=objects&type=all&f=&s=the+past&record=771)
![full bottomed wig](./media/Full-bottomed-wig.png)

- **PADUASOY**: heavy, rich corded or embossed silk fabric, popular in the 18th C. From French - ***peau de soie***, a cloth resembling serge (twill fabric with diagonal lines/ridges on both inner and outer surfaces per a two-up/two-down weave. Worsted serge is what military uniforms are made of. Silk serge is used for linings)
![[Pasted image 20250414101146.jpg]] 
- **Bottom of page a small “T.O.”** = turn over / Molly’s writing is full of spelling like “Bewty” which is a subsequent joke line
- ***Dum memor ipse Mei, dum Spiritus regift artus*** - VIrgil, Æneid, IV.382, “While memory shall last and breath still control my limbs”
- **Carmen** (lowercase) like CARMINA (song poem or verse)
- **Gentleman’s Magazine** 1782—Kind of an Atlantic Monthly—guess who contributed? *Samuel Johnson!*
- **M. T. Ciceroni’s Epistolae**: The letters of Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43BCE) Roman statesman, orator, philosopher, and writer with 800+ letters surviving; 16th century-and-on his writing style was admired and imitated in English
- **“Rod in a pickle”** - rod, method of punishment; pickle, something preserved for future use. So “holding displeasure as a rod-in-a-pickle over the heads of all the ne’er-do-wells” is holding the THREAT of displeasure as a way to keep people in line WITHOUT actual punishment.
- ***Life is a vale of tears:*** Psalm 84:6 **MAYBE** also Psalter ***(Metrical Maybe???)***  also, description of a helicopter parent feels marvelously modern 
- **Mrs Chapone (1727-1801)** Contributed to the Rambler AND Gentleman’s Magazine and wrote “Letters on the Improvement of the Mind (1773) and **Mrs Carter (1717-1806)** many languages and in 1758 published first translation of Epictetus *THE Stoic Philosopher*- More about them later but they were important writers and were friends of Samuel Johnson - of course they were
- **“Old original post with stamp in the corner”** **get pic**
- ”Before Miss Edgeworth’s “Patronage” had banished wafers from polite society”: Patronage was a book (1814) with a character who was offended by a letter she received that was sealed with a wafer: “I wonder how any man can have the impertinence to send me his spittle” (I, 248) 
- **FRANKS** were in great request, and were even used as a means of paying debts by needy Members of Parliament.
- **Letters to be “cut open not broken”** - sealing wax image of coat of arms not to be broken
- “**Sesquipedalian**” writing - foot and a half long _sesqui_ = 1-½ pedalis =foot looonng polysyllabic words
- “Herod, Tetrach of Idumea” misspoken version of “Herod Petrarch of Etruiæ - not funny joke
- **Buonaparte** (Bony)1805 invasion fears - FRANCE IS HOW FAR FROM SO COAST OF UK? Napoleonic wars 1803-1815, invasion not likely. In Northeast England - BUG OUT BAG LINK
- **David and Goliath**, son of Jesse (I Samuel 17)
- **Apollyon (Greek version) and Abbadon (Hebrew version)** are names for an archangel In Revelation 9:11—> _“And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.” (_Revelation 9:11, KJV_)
	**Meaning:**
	- **Abaddon** (_Hebrew_) means **“destruction”** or **“place of destruction.”**
    - **Apollyon** (_Greek_) means **“destroyer.”**
    - Both refer to **the angel of the Abyss**, often understood not as a benevolent archangel, but a **fallen or destructive angel**, or even a personification of destruction itself.
    - **It’s overblown biblical satire**—calling someone “Apollyon” in _Cranford_ is like referring to a strict schoolmarm as “Beelzebub.”
- *Bonus Bernardus non video omnia* The Blessed Bernard does not see everything - maybe said by St Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153)— This quote is often attributed (possibly apocryphally) to **Peter Abelard**, the 12th-century theologian, as a **gentle jab at St. Bernard of Clairvaux**, with whom he clashed theologically.
	**Meaning:**
		Even the wisest man (here, _Blessed Bernard_) can be wrong sometimes.
	**Why It’s Funny in** **Cranford**
	This Latinism is likely dropped in by a self-serious character trying to sound scholarly while **dismissing someone else’s opinion**—but doing it with just enough _veneer of humility_ that they appear gracious, when really they’re saying:
> 	“Even _he_ didn’t know everything—and by implication, I’m right and Bernard was wrong.”
		It’s the 19th-century genteel version of a **mic drop in Latin.**
## Post-chapter Notes
- Use one candle at a time but switch to keep them at the same length in case company comes HA! (Nicely done in the mini-series)
- LOVE that Mary Smith would have ***sat on the rug*** to sew by firelight
- The miss’ Jenkyns’ mom’s stalling until she got the paduasoy HA! That’s an 18 year old’s reason for getting married, I guess?
- The severe and forcible picture of the responsibilities of mothers letter reminded me of 1741 Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God - Jonathan Edwards AND sprained ankle meant wife couldn’t write (Yellow Wallpaper)
- “Molly, when you leave your room, go upstairs before going down”—??? b/c nursery is up???
- Miss J the most beautiful baby <3 
- Further Carmen joke He wrote in Latin, she labeled them “Hebrew” HA! 
- Mother can’t answer Miss J’s (many) questions so stirs the fire or sends her on an errand…Mary Wollstonecraft would have something to say about this scene!
- Chapone and Carter and Bluestockings (see below for big notes)
- Modern Bug-out bags **LINK TO VIDEO**

## Miscellaneous
Xxxx
Yes! Those are real historical women writers, both part of the 18th-century English Bluestocking movement—educated, literary women who promoted female intellectualism and moral development. Gaskell is absolutely name-dropping intentionally here, and the choices are brilliant for Cranford’s themes of domestic gentility, moral seriousness, and self-improvement.
⸻
Mrs. Chapone
Hester Chapone (1727–1801)
• Best known for ***Letters on the Improvement of the Mind*** (1773), addressed to her niece.
	• It was a conduct book for young women, offering advice on moral character, reading habits, and proper behavior.
	• Hugely popular—Cranford-adjacent readers would know her by name.
• Gaskell likely references her as shorthand for the kind of genteel, moral instruction prized in Cranford society.
⸻
Mrs. Carter
Elizabeth Carter (1717–1806)
• A respected scholar, translator, and poet—a genuine intellectual heavyweight.
• Famously translated the ***Discourses of Epictetus*** from Greek in 1758—the first English translation by a woman, and one of the first of Epictetus ***at all***.
• She knew multiple classical and modern languages and was close friends with figures like Samuel Johnson and *Hannah More*.
• Gaskell’s characters likely admire her for her classical learning and moral seriousness.
⸻
Why These Two?
By having her characters casually name-drop Chapone and Carter, Gaskell:
• Shows how well-read and aspirational the Cranford ladies are (especially in moral and genteel literature),
• Satirizes the earnest, over-sincere tone of certain kinds of self-improvement,
• And pays homage to a lineage of serious female thinkers without needing to shout it.
