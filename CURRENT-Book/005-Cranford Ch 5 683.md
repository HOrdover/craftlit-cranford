Cranford ==ERIK - I made notes in the Slack channel - I've really messed things up with not recording the week-of. I'm going to need to pay more attention.==    
**==I'm not sure how much you'll need to cut off to recalculate the book talk/post-chapter audio==**.
==BUT I have a solution to not having to wait for me! You still have access to Descript, right? - you can [get the AI to ***regenerate*** my voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=866wu6ux_2M) with the proper time codes! Even if you just upload that little timecode file, I think it can regenerate me well enough.==    
==ALL TIME CODES BELOW WILL NEED TO BE ADJUSTED AFTER YOU MAKE THE CUTS==

## BOOK TALK—Re-hash Notes
- 17:35 - Last week, the lovely Mr Holbrook and his very sad passing. 
## Pre-hash Notes
19:24 START BOOK TALK
- 20:24 **Joint- Stock bank:** > A **bank owned by shareholders**, operating under a **charter** or act of Parliament, and offering services to the public. 
	- Unlike older private banks (run by individuals or families), joint-stock banks were **corporations,** meaning **shared risk** and more **capital**.     
		- How bank books worked— A **bank book** (also called a **passbook**) was given to bank customers to record all transactions in their account—- Every deposit and withdrawal was manually written into the book **by a bank clerk.** The customer’s copy was **their only proof** of the account’s balance.
- 22:33 **Envelope usage** / turning inside out (ETSY doing this NOW)
	- Whole vs half sheet and crossed letters
- 25:03 **STRING** and **Indian-rubber rings**     
- 26:05 “India-rubber” was the 19th-century term for what we now just call **rubber**—and India-rubber _rings_ were **small rubber loops or bands** like we use today.     
	- Came from the latex of tropical trees (especially _Hevea brasiliensis_)     
- 28:08 **TONQUIN beans**: TONKA beans: Tonka beans are the wrinkled, black seeds of the Dipteryx odorata tree, native to South America. Chefs outside the US use them in desserts and to replace nuts. AND ILLEGAL in USA since 1954 due to presence of liver damaging “coumarin” - [video on the beans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=392UXLR-TWs) - and *[this video was released **just after I recorded this episode**](https://youtu.be/tgHEMFM6KY4?si=lJmaYpKvnYM9bgOA)!*
![](https://produits.bienmanger.com/37572-2w0h0_Whole_Tonka_Beans.jpg)- 30:24 [Full bottomed wig:](https://museums.fivecolleges.edu/detail.php?museum=&t=objects&type=all&f=&s=the+past&record=771)
![full bottomed wig](./media/Full-bottomed-wig.png)

- 32:09 **PADUASOY**: heavy, rich corded or embossed silk fabric, From French - ***peau de soie***, a cloth resembling serge (twill fabric with diagonal lines/ridges on both inner and outer surfaces per a two-up/two-down weave.)
![[Pasted image 20250414101146.jpg]] 
- 33:44 **Bottom of page a small “T.O.”** = turn over / Molly’s writing is full of spelling like “Bewty” which is a subsequent joke line
- 35:14 ***Dum memor ipse Mei, dum Spiritus regift artus*** - Virgil, Æneid, IV.382, “While memory shall last and breath still control my limbs”
- 35:55 **Carmen** (lowercase) like CARMINA (song poem or verse)
- 36:20 **Gentleman’s Magazine** 1782—Kind of an Atlantic Monthly—guess who contributed? *Samuel Johnson!*
- 36:45 **M. T. Ciceroni’s Epistolae**: The letters of Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43BCE) Roman statesman, orator, philosopher, and writer with 800+ letters surviving
- **Heather before recording, in garden, with skewer pack**:
![[Don't Panic.jpeg]] 
- 38:05 **“Rod in a pickle”** - rod, method of punishment; pickle, something preserved for future use. 
- 39:07 ***Life is a vale of tears:*** Psalm 84:6 also, description of a helicopter parent feels marvelously modern 
- 39:46 **Mrs Chapone (1727-1801)** Contributed to the Rambler AND Gentleman’s Magazine and wrote “Letters on the Improvement of the Mind (1773) and **Mrs Carter (1717-1806)** many languages and in 1758 published first translation of Epictetus *THE Stoic Philosopher*.
- 41:00 "Before Miss Edgeworth’s ***'Patronage'*** had banished wafers from polite society...”: Patronage was a book (1814) with a character who was offended by a letter she received that was sealed with a wafer: **“I wonder how any man can have the impertinence to send me his spittle**” (I, 248) 
- 42:35 **“Old original post with stamp in the corner”** not exactly the right watermark, but you get the idea...![](https://nycroblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/zqm-i-28-6-brittania.jpg?w=768)
- 43:55 “**Sesquipedalian**” writing - foot and a half long _sesqui_ = 1-½ pedalis =foot looonng polysyllabic words
- 44:40 **Buonaparte** (Bony)1805 invasion fears - In case you still need to build your own [BUG OUT BAG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5CitQHdGg&ab_channel=Pam%27sPOV)
- 46:23**David and Goliath**, son of Jesse (I Samuel 17)
	- **Apollyon (Greek version) and Abbadon (Hebrew version)** are names for an archangel In Revelation 9:11—> _“And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.” (_Revelation 9:11, KJV_)
		- **Meaning:**
			- **Abaddon** (_Hebrew_) means **“destruction”** or **“place of destruction.”**
			- **Apollyon** (_Greek_) means **“destroyer.”**
			- **It’s overblown biblical satire**—calling someone “Apollyon” in _Cranford_ is like referring to a strict schoolmarm as “Beelzebub.”
- 47:30 *Bonus Bernardus non video omnia* The Blessed Bernard does not see everything - maybe said by St Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153)— This quote is often attributed (possibly apocryphally) to **Peter Abelard**, the 12th-century theologian, as a **gentle jab at St. Bernard of Clairvaux**, with whom he clashed theologically.
	- **Meaning:** Even the wisest man (here, _Blessed Bernard_) can be wrong sometimes.

## ==ERIK - CAN YOU PUT SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN over the video saying that my 'tutorial' on building the pangolin will be released separately with sound...once I'm done ;)==
## Post-chapter Notes
- ***Chapone*** and ***Carter*** and ***Bluestockings*** (see below for big notes)
	- real historical women writers, both part of the 18th-century English Bluestocking movement—educated, literary women who promoted female intellectualism and moral development. Gaskell is absolutely name-dropping intentionally here for Cranford’s themes of domestic gentility, moral seriousness, and self-improvement.     
⸻    
Mrs. Hester Chapone (1727–1801)     
- Best known for ***Letters on the Improvement of the Mind*** (1773), addressed to her niece.
	- It was a conduct book for young women, offering advice on moral character, reading habits, and proper behavior.
	- Hugely popular—Cranford-adjacent readers would know her by name.     
⸻    
Mrs. Elizabeth Carter (1717–1806)     
- A respected scholar, translator, and poet—a genuine intellectual heavyweight.
	- Famously translated the ***Discourses of Epictetus*** from Greek in 1758—the first English translation by a woman, and one of the first of Epictetus ***at all***.
	- She knew multiple classical and modern languages and was close friends with figures like Samuel Johnson and *Hannah More*.
