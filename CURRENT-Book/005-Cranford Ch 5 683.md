- Paduasoy: heavy, rich corded or embossed silk fabric, popular in the 18th C. From French pou-de-some, a cloth resembling serge (twill fabric with diagonal lines/ridges on both inner and outer surfaces per a two-up/two-down weave. Worsted serge is what military uniforms are made of. Silk serge is used for linings)

- “Rod in a pickle” - rod, method of punishment; pickle, something preserved for future use. So “holding displeasure as a rod-in-a-pickle over the heads of all the ne’er-do-wells” is holding the THREAT of displeasure as a way to keep people in line WITHOUT actual punishment.

## Miscellaneous
Xxxx
Yes! Those are real historical women writers, both part of the 18th-century English Bluestocking movement—educated, literary women who promoted female intellectualism and moral development. Gaskell is absolutely name-dropping intentionally here, and the choices are brilliant for Cranford’s themes of domestic gentility, moral seriousness, and self-improvement.
⸻
Mrs. Chapone
Hester Chapone (1727–1801)
• Best known for ***Letters on the Improvement of the Mind*** (1773), addressed to her niece.
	• It was a conduct book for young women, offering advice on moral character, reading habits, and proper behavior.
	• Hugely popular—Cranford-adjacent readers would know her by name.
• Gaskell likely references her as shorthand for the kind of genteel, moral instruction prized in Cranford society.
⸻
Mrs. Carter
Elizabeth Carter (1717–1806)
• A respected scholar, translator, and poet—a genuine intellectual heavyweight.
• Famously translated the ***Discourses of Epictetus*** from Greek in 1758—the first English translation by a woman, and one of the first of Epictetus ***at all***.
• She knew multiple classical and modern languages and was close friends with figures like Samuel Johnson and *Hannah More*.
• Gaskell’s characters likely admire her for her classical learning and moral seriousness.
⸻
Why These Two?
By having her characters casually name-drop Chapone and Carter, Gaskell:
• Shows how well-read and aspirational the Cranford ladies are (especially in moral and genteel literature),
• Satirizes the earnest, over-sincere tone of certain kinds of self-improvement,
• And pays homage to a lineage of serious female thinkers without needing to shout it.
