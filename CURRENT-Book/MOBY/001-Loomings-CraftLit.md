# Chapter 1 – Loomings

## Summary

Ishmael, our narrator, introduces himself and shares his reasons for going to sea—an antidote to “a damp, drizzly November” in his soul. This opening sets the philosophical and symbolic tone for the entire novel, inviting the reader into a deeply reflective narrative that blends humor, melancholy, and grandeur.

## CraftLit Companion Annotations

### “Call me Ishmael.”

**Deeper Note**: In the Hebrew Bible, Ishmael is Abraham’s first son, born to the bondwoman Hagar. After Sarah, Abraham’s wife, bears a son of her own (Isaac), Ishmael is cast out. The name Ishmael—meaning “God hears”—is often associated with exile, survival, and divine witness. Melville’s narrator adopts this name not as his own, but as a signpost: he identifies with the archetypal outcast, the spiritual wanderer. This sets the tone for a novel full of metaphysical searching and marginal identities.

### Water as Magnetic Pull

**Context**: Ishmael reflects on the almost mystical attraction people feel to the ocean. He walks the streets of Manhattan just to be near the water. His desire to ship out is framed not as a job but a calling—one rooted in awe, dread, and a search for meaning.

**CraftLit Insight**: This is Melville’s invocation of the *sublime*. The ocean is not beautiful in a postcard sense—it is vast, unknowable, and divine. This chapter echoes Romanticism and Transcendentalism, with a dash of cosmic horror.
Aaron’s comment “I don’t know why people say Moby Dick is such a dry book?! It’s all about loving water!” D-dum DUM!

### Satirical Humor

**Note**: Despite the philosophical tone, Ishmael’s narrative voice is dry, witty, and self-aware. He jokes about knocking people's hats off when he feels grim. This comic voice softens the weight of the themes and invites us to trust him—even as he remains unknowable.
