# Online full-text notes

### Everything I've got

These are my notes I'm using to record, but also notes of things I chose to leave out (there's JUST SO MUCH). Some of the note text in these files has been directly copied from other websites. I'm not publishing this as original work. It's an amalgam of everything I've found. 

I just thought it might be useful for you to have access to. 

If you have notes to add, please email me heather@craftlit.com or call 206-350-1642
