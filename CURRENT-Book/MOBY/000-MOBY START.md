# Need maps and notes on ETYMOLOGY and EXTRACTS
# ETYMOLOGY

## Summary

Mock-serious Opening to the book (is he trying to Hawthorne this? LOL)
“He loved to dust his old grammars [teaching books]; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.”
HA!

## Yes, both the “Etymology” and the “Extracts” sections are original to Moby-Dick and absolutely part of Melville’s sense of humor—and also his larger literary purpose.

  

1. Originality

  

These two prefatory sections were included in the first edition of Moby-Dick (1851). They were not added later by editors or publishers.

  

2. Melville’s Humor and Satire

  

The subtitles are deliberately funny and satirical:

• “Etymology (Supplied by a late consumptive Usher to a grammar school)”

This pokes fun at the pedantry of scholastic definitions and the tendency of academic types to over-explain. The imaginary “usher” is both pitiable and comic—a sickly, underpaid school assistant who painstakingly contributes a few etymologies no one really asked for.

• “Extracts (Supplied by a sub-sub-librarian)”

Even funnier, this fictional “sub-sub-librarian” is so far down the institutional ladder he’s almost underground. Melville uses this character to parody the encyclopedic, quote-heavy tendencies of serious scholarship. The tone is intentionally dry, fussy, and excessive, compiling “proof” from literature and scripture that whales are significant, symbolic, and worthy of reverence.

  

These fictional contributors also signal that the novel will blend seriousness with absurdity. It’s Melville setting the stage for a book that’s as much metaphysical exploration as it is sea yarn—and doing it with a wink.

  

3. Literary Function

  

Beyond the humor, these sections contribute to the novel’s mock-scholarly framing—a stylistic device borrowed from earlier works like Tristram Shandy or Don Quixote. Melville is both mocking and embracing the ambition of writing a “universal book” by starting with a pseudo-academic apparatus.

  

So yes—those subtitles are pure Melville: ironic, sly, and deeply literary.

### Satirical Humor

**Note**: Despite the philosophical tone, Ishmael’s narrative voice is dry, witty, and self-aware. He jokes about knocking people's hats off when he feels grim. This comic voice softens the weight of the themes and invites us to trust him—even as he remains unknowable.
