Um…1926 John Barrymore “Moby Dick” Their “Sfx” aren’t so S… more like “damn! How’d they do that when Jaws had so much trouble with modern equipment”…

And yes…there’s a screwy love story in the way, but watch until you see Ahab on the whale!

Knowing how heavy those cameras were, I can’t figure out how the heck they got some of the shots.

Also, actual multi-racial (and semi-racist) casting in 1926?!?! (And OFC, the music is NOT period specific, so pls turn it off)
