Here is a clean, fully edited Markdown transcription of both photographed pages.

I corrected obvious OCR errors but kept your original wording, punctuation, and spacing unless obviously a typo.

AI Identification

1) What to look for — for real

a) content is too slick, polished, doesn’t look/sound like the author (normally)

b) something about the content is ringing bells in your head. TRUST YOURSELF

- check for a date of when the channel/account started
- check to see if there is an associated website — check out the website
- is there a date (website) on the post — trying to make something forced evergreen
- if YT/IG/Tik/FB — look for information under the content
- also check to see if there are comments, check to see if others are suspicious. (AI bot?)
- For reviews (Amazon etc.) check to see WHO is leaving the reviews — actually, check to see if there is a range of reviews that are polar opposites. One one-star rating isn’t a problem. Several, all saying, “this is useless” or spelling errors (because scanned content on Internet Archive can easily have typos—scammers aren’t going to proofread).

TWO THINGS* SCAMMERS AND AI ARE NOT THE SAME, BUT RESULTS ARE SIMILAR

2) What to do when you’ve checked the easy stuff?

a) Google Image Search (LINK)

b) Ask readers to share their go-to tricks and sites they use

- Snopes for political things is a good start. Gro and News covering a story — it’s worth it to “follow the money” to see who will benefit from the bias being presented.
- AP Wire and Reuters are still amazingly good/unbiased.
- Remember that Walter Cronkite was a news READER. Not an anchor, not a pundit (Douglas Adams was the first place I heard pundits being ridiculed. Now I understand why). If that doesn’t mean anything to you, go watch the (very enjoyable) Broadcast News.  
	If you want to see where the Broadcast News problems really started, watch Network. Not funny but oh my God it’s still a powerful movie.  

- if all you are watching are people talking ABOUT a news story, you’re not hearing the news. You’re hearing opinions. Again, follow the money.
- and again, Ground News/AP/Reuters. If you really want to blow your mind, watch international news from another country — you’ll be amazed at how different USA news looks from an outside point of view.
-   

3) What to do when you think you’ve found AI slop/scams

a) post a comment asking, “Are you a bot?” or “AI Slop?”

Not accusing, but logging your comment may help someone else with more time feel like digging a little more.

b) post on social media asking, “@ANYONE KNOW if this is a bot?”

c) DO NOT accuse any post of being a scam or a bot.

We’re a litigious (SP?) country. Don’t attack — ask.

d) share here any techniques you’ve used to successfully track down AI slop/scams.

Below is a list of things to try/places to go to help you track down scammers. Take to Library, etc etc etc.

How to use AI to find AI-Slop

1) give it a link or transcript and say “something in here seems fishy/untrue. Add ‘don’t return an answer unless you have a site or path of your research.’”

a) you can start by asking the AI to “think like a researcher”

- tell it that you ALWAYS want links to any answer it gives you (you’ll need to remind it)

2) If it returns 

“you’re right to wonder if something is wrong with this”

 that does 

NOT

 mean you’re on to something.

AI/ChatGPT has been directed to value an answer (ANY ANSWER) as better than a non-answer/not knowing.

This is how you get hallucinations.

It’s also been programmed to respond with a positive statement about your question/comment.

You can try to get it to stop that, but it may be a losing battle.

3) know that you can go back after any response and say,

“that strikes me as odd. Can you look more at this aspect of the issue?”

a) sometimes it takes me 5–10 go-rounds to have gotten what I needed.

Patience matters more than the answer.

4) What does a complete answer look like?

a) you’ve been given links to explain/support the AI’s conclusions

b) you have CHECKED those links for bias (follow the money), validity, and truth

- LINK OUT TO WHAT MAKES AN ARG VALID  
	c) you can explain it to a 10-year-old
- there may be many steps, it might be complicated, but the explanation doesn’t circle back on itself.
- It makes linear sense.

# **AI SLOP / SCAM SPOTTER — Quick Guide**

_(CraftLit Condensed Edition)_

### **1️⃣ Quick Reality Check**

- Does the content feel **too polished** or “off” for the creator?
	
- Is something nagging at you? **Trust that feeling.**
	
- Look for **start date**, **website**, and **real-world presence**.
	
- Check comments — do they look human or botted?

---

### **2️⃣ Fast Verification Tools**

- **Google Image Search**: find reused photos
	
- **Snopes / AP / Reuters / Ground News**: bias + origin checks
	
- **Follow the Money**: who benefits?

---

### **3️⃣ When You Suspect AI Slop**

- Comment: _“Can anyone confirm if this is a bot/AI?”_
	
- Don’t accuse — **ask**. (We are a litigious country.)
	
- Share the post with people who like digging.

---

### **4️⃣ Use AI to Spot AI**

Ask your model:

> “Something here seems off. Don’t answer unless you give sources.”

Then check:

- Are the links **real**?
	
- Do they support the claim?
	
- Can **you explain it to a 10-year-old**?

If not → it’s likely slop.

---

### **5️⃣ What a Good Answer Looks Like**

- External sources
	
- You checked for bias
	
- Explanation is **linear**, not circular
	
- You can summarize it simply

---

# **BONUS: Pro-Level Scam/AI Slop Red Flags People Miss**

💡 **1. Repetition patterns**

AI and scammers both reuse phrases at weird intervals:

“in this essay,” “that being said,” “overall,” “it’s important to note.”

If you hear the same phrase **every 2–3 paragraphs**, it’s AI.

---

💡 **2. “Forced evergreen” tricks**

Scammers avoid dates, timestamps, or references that age.

If everything feels generic/on-purpose timeless = bad sign.

---

💡 **3. Too many emojis or weirdly formal tone**

Bots tend to do:

- Overly cheerful tone
	
- Formal academic tone

	Rarely the natural in-between.

---

💡 **4. ‘Pattern of Praise’ comments**

Bot networks leave comments like:

- “This is so helpful!”
	
- “I never knew this before!”
	
- “Great content as always!”

	with no specifics.

If comment sections feel like a **smile wallpaper**, be suspicious.

---

💡 **5. Misused idioms**

AI struggles with:

- “throw someone under the bus”
	
- “bated breath”
	
- “toe the line”
	
- “free rein” (often becomes “free reign”)

Idioms = fingerprint tests.

---

💡 **6. No local details**

AI-authored slop avoids anything local, tactile, or sensory.

People mention:

- weather
	
- specific places
	
- concrete memories
	
- sensory language

	Bots = abstractions.

---

💡 **7. Answering confidently with zero sources**

If the model drops **no citation trail**, that’s not knowledge — it’s improv.

---

If you’d like, I can now:

📌 Build a **square Canva version** with CraftLit branding

📌 Build a **Reel/TikTok vertical version**

📌 Create a **printable 1-page PDF handout**

Just tell me which format(s) you’d like!

- BUYER BEWARE: 
	- I'll have links to everything I mention in the shownotes, so you can do your own dives if you like.
	- I want to tell you a story of my last five days, and then give you a CTA at the end. I'll provide you with all the materials you might need, so you won't have to do anything beyond talking to your friends and family—unless you want to ;) 
	- several frustrating things happened to me in the last five days and the frustration all had a similar cause. While looking for documents, instruction books, pattern, books, manuals,  I kept finding/being recommended what is colloquially being referred to as AI slop. 
	- But where it really started was when the YouTube algorithm served me a video with a very compelling picture and click-bait-y title. I'd never seen something that appeared to be a Victorian Photograph where the video maker had done the research to source who was in one of those photos and why it was taken.
		- The short version: I still haven't.
		- It took about 10 min before I started to wonder and 14 minutes before I started checking comments. One lone poster kept saying "the story isn't real... it's fiction... not real history, do a Google search..."
	- Then over the weekend I was looking for tatting patterns—both new and historical. Lately I've started paying more attention to reviews on book sale sites and the extra minutes invested in that paid off this time.
		- I saw prices from 2.97 to 30 for Paper copies of texts and in the $30 instance, it had a kindle version for $27. 
			- That's a clue that something's wrong.
			- Another clue: one book was on Amazon from "Unknown Publisher"
			- But the one that made me dive deep was a book, allegedly from 1888, $2.97 for an ebook download, not on amazon, only on the website. How did I find it? PINTEREST. == NEED LINK TO HOW TO ESCAPE PINTEREST LINKS ON GOOGLE==
			- Pinterest sent me to the publisher's page, I could tell something was fishy. But I wasn't getting anywhere with doing my own research. I knew something was wrong, I just couldn't figure out what it was.
				- So Here's the thing I learned about AI slop, one of the fastest, and best ways to find out if some thing is a Slop, is to ask AI.
				- I'll share the response I got from CHAT GPT so you can see it's response, BUT—I've spent months training my Chatbot to only respond with verifyable information—if it can't provide links and sources, I don't want it to give me an answer. GPT has a mission to ALWAYS HAVE AN ANSWER—that means it will make one up if it can't find one. I've had to ***train*** mine to say "I didn't find a direct answer to that, but here's what I DID find..."
		- I've mentioned before, the Garbage in/Garbage out directive of audio recording. It's true for AI, too. If you frame your question poorly, you'll get a marginally useful answer. (HINT: once you DO get a useful response, ask the ChatBot how you SHOULD have phrased the question at the outset)
			-   You CAN INSTRUCT CHAT GPT to "respond like a college researcher, with links, verifiable dates, and accurate details. If you find none, tell me that."
	- However, I know not everyone wants to invest the time and hassle into doing that. Instead, when you find AI Slop — if on YouTube, give the video or post a thumbs-down and add a comment like "AI Slop?"—not accusing, just raising the spectre.
		- If you can mark a video "uninterested" or "don't show me again"—do that. 
		- Share the lousy site or Slop channel or scam product on your social media with a "This is AI SLop—do not spend money here" and use #aislop  so it's easy to find all the posts with that tag
		- These SAME things can be done in various ways on Facebook, Instagram, and ==PINTEREST!??!?!!?!?==
	- I'll be spending the rest of my week rounding up sources for how to spot this garbage and how to respond, how to detach from as many algorithmic feeds as possible, and I'll put that all on my substack—which I'll link back to from the shownotes.
		- I know I've said this over and over, but I'll say it again for our younger listeners—back before Serial showed the world what Podcasts were and showed corporations how much money they could make from them, people had blogs. Just normal people. They wrote about and documented with pictures and instructions the nifty things they did. The bar for entry was low and you could find AMAZING things—usually by following a blogger's BlogRoll.
			- That means, if you only ever found new bloggers via the blogs of people you already trusted, you were rarely (if ever) going to be disappointed with the content you were consuming.
	- EVERY TIME we get lazy and let an Algorithm decide what we should watch or see next, we're letting go of that control a little bit more.
- I'm seriously concerned about people one generation older than I am who only just learned that Nigerian Princes don't generally need to do some complex banking with ***them***. It's going to get worse. 
	- As part of the CraftLiteratti, I hope that you—like me—go to your public libraries and offer to host a meet-up—not a class, you don't have to prepare anything more than what I'll put in the shownotes for you. Just go, be there, be kind, and let people come ask you if something is safe. Your goal isn't to tell them yes or no—your goal is to show them all the ways that THEY can find out for themselves.
	- Because it isn't only BUYER BEWARE—it's SANITY Beware—it won't take many times of being hoodwinked before everyone stops trusting everything. It's one of the reasons you'll notice CraftLit adding "never AI" tags to episodes and social media posts.
- AND because I hate ending on a downer, here's something I stumbled on (on a blog) that I ordered and it DOES work: THIMTEC - thimble tape. Can I use it to push very tiny needles through very tight fabrics? Nope. Can I use it when I'm handsewing in general? YES! Far fewer sore fingertips at the end of the day. Can it help grip needles when you pull it through? YES! - though FINGER COTS still work best. THe THimtec doesn't tear - so you'll need scissors and I found that one 10"/25cm piece to start was fine, but adding another layer in a more targeted location made this VERY useful. Circuclation was find.

## From CHAT GPT:
*I’ll break this into two parts: first what I found about the book you mentioned, and second a draft of how you might explain to your audience how to spot “AI-slop” or dubious books/videos masquerading as genuine historical or craft resources*
*⸻*
#### ***1. What I found on the title and publisher***

***Title: The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete Guide to the Work‑Table (Sixth Edition, 1888)***
	*• Yes — there is a book titled The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete Guide to the Work-Table (or very similar) dating to the 1880s. For example, the version “Second Edition” is listed with publisher E. Harrison, London, 1885.*  
	*• Archive.org hosts a digitised version: “The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete Guide to the Work-Table: Containing Instructions in Berlin Work, Crochet, Drawn-Thread Work, Embroidery, Knitting, Knotting or Macrame, Lace, Netting, Poonah Painting, & Tatting, with numerous illustrations and coloured designs” — London : E. Harrison.*  
	*• Catalogue info: HathiTrust shows “The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete guide to the worktable : containing instructions in Berlin work … & tatting, with numerous illustrations and coloured designs.” Publisher stated as London : E. Harrison.*  
	*• An entry shows the Sixth Edition (1888) being re-published (modern print or Kindle perhaps) by “Romantic English” website.*  

***Publisher(s)***
	*• Original 19th-c edition: The publisher is given as **E. Harrison (London)**.*   
	*• I did not locate a legitimate historical publisher named “Romance English” (or “romance, English”) in the context of an 1888 craft book. The site selling the Sixth Edition uses “Romantic English” as a modern publisher/distributor website (likely a re-print or marketing imprint) rather than the original 1888 imprint.*  
	*• Therefore: the title is very likely genuine (a Victorian craft manual) and published originally by E. Harrison in 1888 (or earlier). But the “publisher, romance, English” does not appear to be an original historical publisher of the 1888 edition; it’s likely a modern re-print imprint or website name.*
	
***Conclusion for part 1***
	*• ✔ The text appears authentic: the 1880s edition (Sixth Edition 1888) is real.*
	*• ✘ The publisher you quoted (“romance, English”) does not appear to correspond to the original publisher; the original is E. Harrison (London).*
	*• ✔ So you can safely point out the book exists and is real, but you’ll want to clarify accurately: “Originally published by E. Harrison (London) in 1888” rather than “Romance English”.*
*⸻*

#### ***2. How to explain to your audience how to spot AI-scam books/videos***

*Here’s a draft outline and some language you could use on your podcast to help listeners/viewers identify suspicious content — especially when it claims to be historical or craft-authentic but may be manufactured, misleading or AI-generated. You can adapt this to your tone on CraftLit.*

##### ***a) Why this matters***

*• Because AI tools (and mass-digitisation + algorithmic generation of metadata) make it very easy for items to look legitimate: correct-format title, historical date, vintage-looking cover, “edition 1888” etc.*

*• But authenticity requires more: verifiable publisher, edition, provenance, library/catalogue records.*

*• If a video or book claims to be “based on a text from 1888” (for example) and uses that as authority, you want to check carefully.*

*• As you noted, one video presented as historical fact may actually be fictional or heavily embellished, yet comments show people accepting it as real — that’s the risk: misinformation embedded in “craft” or “historical” guise.*

##### ***b) What to look for: Red flags & verification steps***

### *Here are practical checks you can tell your audience:*

 #### ***Red flags***

1. ***Mismatch of publisher/date/edition***
*• A book claims “Sixth Edition 1888” but the publisher named doesn’t exist or cannot be traced historically.*
*• The imprint is vague (e.g., “Romance English” rather than a known historical publisher).*
*• The edition number (sixth) but no records of earlier editions or clear lineage.*

2. ***Modern re-print with mismatched metadata***
*• A modern seller reprints an old title but the imprint and metadata are changed or ambiguous.*
*• The “new” book claims to be 1888 but may be a “facsimile” or marketing version — not the original.*
*• The text inside may not clearly indicate original vs modern edits.*

3. ***Over-dramatic or sensational video/book that claims “forgotten history”***
*• Video says “Untold story of Victorian women’s craft” and uses the title as evidence — but the source is unsupported.*
*• Comments affirming the “sad true story” although evidence is thin or absent.*
*• One user tries to correct (“it’s fiction…”) yet the crowd accepts it.*

4. ***Absence of credible library catalogue or archival record***
*• Major library catalogues (HathiTrust, WorldCat, etc) don’t list the edition or publisher.*
*• No DOI, no stable academic citation, only commercial print on demand listing.*

5. ***Too perfect packaging / “nice old cover” but no provenance***
*• A seller displays a Victorian-style cover, but the interior or description shows modern design or no page scans.*
*• The description uses marketing buzz (“Victorian crafting masterpiece”) rather than bibliographic detail.*

### ***Verification steps***

If it's TOO awful or TOO good a deal or TOO perfect—be suspicious.

1. ***Check library/catalogue records***
*• Search for the exact title in HathiTrust, WorldCat, Google Books, Archive.org. In your case: found on HathiTrust as “The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete guide to the work-table” with E. Harrison, 1885.*  
*• Check edition number, publisher, date.*

2. ***Check for earlier editions / publisher history***
*• If “Sixth Edition, 1888” is claimed, look for the first edition or previous editions (2nd edition 1885 exists per The Met record).*  
*• Does the publisher exist historically? E. Harrison does; “Romance English” appears not.*

3. ***Inspect inside the text / scan if available***
*• Does the preface/intro mention the edition number, date, publisher? For this book: Preface dated London, January 1888.*  
*• Are the illustrations, coloured designs credible for the era?*

4. ***Check modern editions vs original***
*• If you purchase a new print saying “Sixth Edition 1888”, check imprint: is it simply re-published by a modern press (which should say so) or is it claiming original printing?*
*• Sellers often say “facsimile reprint” or “modern edition” — if they don’t, be cautious.*

5. ***Be cautious with videos or books that use historical titles to anchor a narrative***
*• If a video claims “Based on the 1888 manual by The Young Ladies’ Journal” and then weaves a “true story” about a tragic Victorian craftsperson, check whether the manual actually mentions that story.*

*• Ask: where is the archival reference? Which pages? Are there citations? Are images authentic?*

***c) Practical “checklist” you can share***

## *Here’s a quick checklist you could provide:*

*• Title exactly matches a known historical work (with catalog proof).*

*• Edition number and date are verifiable via library records.*

*• Publisher imprint is historically real (or clearly a reprint).*

*• The edition claims vs actual content match (scans show date, preface, etc).*

*• The work inside includes primary craft instructions, not just narration of invented drama.*

*• The video/book gives the source of its information (page numbers, archive links).*

*• The narrative (especially if dramatic) is supported by original sources or clearly labelled as speculation/fiction.*

*• Seller/creator discloses if it is a modern reprint or modern adaptation of a historical work.*

*• If price is very low and claims “rare 1888 edition” but packaging looks brand-new without protective mentions, be cautious (possible print-on-demand).*

***e) Why this matters for your domain (craft + historical accuracy)***

*• For historic craft like shuttle tatting, companion planting, Victorian needlework — **the value lies in authenticity:** patterns, nomenclature, technical instructions used at the time. If a work is fabricated or mis-attributed, you’re chasing ghosts, not genuine tradition.*

*• When creators pull from “AI generated” or loosely verified sources, the instructions may be inaccurate, terminology may be off, and the scene gets distorted (e.g., a video claiming “Victorian women used this exact method in 1888 …” when that method wasn’t documented then).*

*• For your audience (gardeners, craft-people, history buffs) you have credibility by pointing out how to evaluate sources. This reinforces your preference for original sources and unmodernised editions (which you already hold as a principle).*

*• In the context of a podcast episode about the problem of AI-scam books/videos, you can use the shuttle tatting example: you spent two hours, found repeated false claims, discovered a historical source but many videos mis-represent it, etc. That gives a concrete case study.*
