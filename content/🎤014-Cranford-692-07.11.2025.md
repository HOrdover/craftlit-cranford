## Re-hash Notes
10:20 We had a very Sad chapter 13, which ended with Miss Matty thinking about Martha. :( 

## Pre-hash Notes
- 11:50 - Rubric- The Book of Common prayer printed directions for teh service in red. Hens the Rubric (from the Latin word for ‚ÄòRed‚Äù) signified someting of importance and later came to mean ‚Äúinjunction‚Äù or general rule. REALLY??? LATIN FOR RED????
- 13:50 - Mammon - Matthew 6:24, Devil of Covetovness or Demon of Greed (medieval and Milton - lowercase) (in hebrew meant money, modern hebrew. = wealth), , unjust worldly gain -  ANNOTATION is partly WRONG, But there WAS a Syrian God of Wealth
- 19:45 - AAah Voo DEER-ray zhuh *[Ah! Vous dirai-je, Maman](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Ah%21_vous_dirai-je_maman.jpg)* - Basically Twinkle Twinkle Little Star - the easiest piece of music one could learn to play. Mozart had done one of his 12 variations (though, personally, I‚Äôm partial to Tom Lehrer‚Äôs [Clementine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dehXq6a1sJU)) ![[Pasted image 20250707100236.jpg]]
- 21:25 - She could ‚Äútrace out patterns very nicely for Muslin Embroidery, by dint of placing a piece of silver-paper over the design to be copied, and holding both against the window-pane, while she marked the scollop and eyelet-holes‚Äù. **ANNOTATION SAYS** ‚ÄúProbably [broderie anglaise ](https://www.sewhistorically.com/how-to-make-broderie-anglaise-lace-by-hand/)which used scalloped edges and a pattern of holes sewn round with thread like a button-hole.‚Äú![](https://www.sewhistorically.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/How-To-Make-Broderie-Anglaise-Lace-Eyelet-Lace-By-Hand-6-1.jpg)
- 22:55 - a Celestial Globe to learn simple astronomy/constellations  https://fi.edu/en/science-and-education/collection/celestial-globe ![[Pasted image 20250707100335.jpg]]
- 24:35 - [Wool-work and counting threads](https://www.wcfta.com/berlin-wool-work/) - think of [needlepoint and petit-point](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/difference-between-needlepoint-or-petit-point-2479581), ![[Pasted image 20250710175927.png]]but you have to COUNT THE THREADS in a muslin or light canvas backing. Around 1830 v popular to stitch portraits of royalty (again, at least 10 years out of popularity elsewhere, but still popular in Cranford). Printed, gridded patterrns ([Beeton‚Äôs Book of Needlework](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15147/15147-h/15147-h.htm#image_592)) GET LINK WITH hashtag to Berlin Work!
- 27:05 - Under a glass shade - put a glass dome or CLOCHE over things to keep dust off‚Äîwould have been REALLY important b/c it was DUSTY back then and only got worse in London as the Century went on (also used in gerdening for heat retention)![[Pasted image 20250710180429.png]]
- 27:55 - Couchant - lying down in Heraldry Image from Sodacan, CC BY-SA 3.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0>, via Wikimedia Commons  ![[Pasted image 20250707104616.png]]

- 28:35 - East India Tea Company - Founded in 1600 by QE1 and held the chartered right to trade with India and China and IMPORT the tea  as a monopoly until 1834 (BTW, Twining‚Äôs started as a coffee SHOP/Room adding tea in 1717 , bought adjacent building for ladies to take tea(might be Western world‚Äòs oldest dry tea and coffee shop) at No. 216 Strand london in 1706; still operating today -  and logo created in 1787 is worlds oldest in continuous use) B/c the EIC‚Äôs charter was for trade/importing, anyone could SELL the tea.
- 31:25 - our mites: Biblical times a mite was the lowest denomination of coin in Judea (two mites = one lepta (thin or small in Greek) which was equivalent to a quadran, the smallest Roman coin), (also see [Mark 12:43](https://bible.org/sites/bible.org/resources/netbible/index.htm?mar12.htm) re: the Widow‚Äôs Mite where Christ praises the window who gives her last two mites in the temple) Two mites were worth about 1/64th of a denari - a day‚Äôs wage for a common worker, toay about 1/8 of a US penny (1 cent)
- 33:40 - Spills - QUILLING (thank you Aimee!) video of [making Quilled spills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv833gm4WBI) 
- 37:15 - Comfit - nut, seed, etc, covered in sugar coating - link to max miller‚Äôs video on [Sugar Plums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Nk0evkBpE&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD)
