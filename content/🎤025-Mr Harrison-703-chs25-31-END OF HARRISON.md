I found Charles Burns'—the editor's—papers left with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, but I believe they're jpgs of every page! https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn501848?rsc=112566&cv=1&x=1352&y=1746&z=3.3e-4), 
	***Death by Lightning***—4 episodes, Netflix, ALSO very funny until it's not. Trailer: https://youtu.be/6jopqrSojQE?si=4Mdk9-DGpAsgfW5K - stunning cast—some of the best work from Nick Offerman — also good to see Josh Lymon back at the White House. (here's the first installment of "was it accurate" https://youtu.be/1os4ceqJITQ?si=OMWGG2uXLZvLmJl3)

Last week round 2 of chaos ensued—NOW we get the rest of it and our Dénouement 
- which means "un-knot" (not "unravel"—when knitting becomes undone—"untangle, unsnarl" is the secondary and more accurate for literature)
- [Jenny Lind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Lind) - HUGELY famous Swedish [opera singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_singer "Opera singer"), often called the "**Swedish Nightingale**". One of the most highly regarded singers of the 19th century, she performed in [soprano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soprano "Soprano") roles in opera in Sweden and across Europe, and undertook an extraordinarily popular [concert tour of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Lind_tour_of_America,_1850%E2%80%9352 "Jenny Lind tour of America, 1850–52") beginning in 1850. She was a member of the [Royal Swedish Academy of Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Music "Royal Swedish Academy of Music") from 1840.
	- Lind became famous after her performance in _[Der Freischütz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Freisch%C3%BCtz "Der Freischütz")_ in Sweden in 1838. Within a few years, she had suffered vocal damage, but the singing teacher [Manuel García](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Garc%C3%ADa_\(baritone\) "Manuel García (baritone)") saved her voice. She was in great demand in opera roles throughout Sweden and northern Europe during the 1840s, and was closely associated with [Felix Mendelssohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn "Felix Mendelssohn"). After two acclaimed seasons in London, she announced her retirement from opera at the age of 29.
	- In 1850, Lind went to the United States at the invitation of the showman [P. T. Barnum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Barnum "P. T. Barnum"). She gave 93 large-scale concerts for him and then continued to tour under her own management. 
- ***Prolix***—too many words (Emperor from Amadeus use audio for podcast/Video for YouTube https://youtu.be/hMWy3EpEo_o?si=_iJ9QZIrIMlXZmCF cut from :29 to 2:02)
- Fermented brined pickles have probiotics—recipe?—it'll be a joke-line

#### Pre-hash Notes
- Not a lot needed—as usual with ends of books, all the tough stuff—learning who everyone is, exposition, exposition and context/history-based jokes, etc mostly are done. So... sit back and enjoy the end.
