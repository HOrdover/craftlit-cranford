Here are the patterns for the raffle/give away. I also have a free Book Tracker quilt pattern that people might be interested in. It's also an FPP pattern and can be found here: [https://www.snugglepuzzle.com/book-tracker-quilt/](https://www.snugglepuzzle.com/book-tracker-quilt/) It would be a great first pattern for people who haven't tried FPP before.
Thanks again for all you do!
