## B-Block-BOOK TALK—Re-hash Notes
Signor Brunoni and Miss Pole's Magicsplaining - she only gets worse in this chapter

## Pre-hash Notes
- Doctors are also dentists - don't forget
- More Gaskell-commentary in this chapter, like in Your Ladyship
- The panic in this chapter was a common fear - it's just that this time it came to Cranford.
- Remember that the French fought with the Colonists against Britain. The Brits also fought the French in Spain during the Peninsular War (1808-1815) vs Napoleon.
- Napoleon made everyone in England jumpy and worried about Spies.
- Madame de Staël with a turban on and another of Mr Denon- 
- ![[Pasted image 20250603103538.png]]
- apparently, Madame Desta was very interesting because Miss Gaskell heard from a friend about her friendship with Madame de Staël and her riding across Asia Miner, as a Turkish horseMAN turban, pistols, & all.
- Denon was an art expert who travelled with napoleon to Egypt. One of his sketches is of a man in a turban:
- ![[Pasted image 20250603103943.png]]
- A bit about spoons - they're probably silver
- There is a reference to Philomel which doesn't match the real story - which is quite upsetting. This sounds like Mary Smith/Gaskell is using Philomel as a stand in for Nightingale so she doesn't repeat the word right away.
- Story of a girl left in charge of a great house in Cumberland - apparently this was a proto-urban legend told here but originally written down as having happened in Scotland
- Carlo is Mrs. Jamieson's very unpleasant, cream-drinking dog.
- You'll hear a reference to a mysterious "deadly force" - this is a reference to proto-mesmerism, that sort of thing. Stories of doctors in the late 18th century with the exertion of the will through the eyes or "the gaze" was commonly believed to be potentially powerful. George III's doctor, Francis Willis, exerted control over the demented monarch in this way before restoring him to a straight jacket
- Cheltenham, adjacent to the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire, England, got famous for being a spa town.
- virago—domineering bad tempered woman
- diffidence - modesty or shyness
- videlicet - viz: _Videlicet_ (2. > **vi-DEL-i-sit** or wi-del-eh-ket in Latin) is a Latin adverb meaning **“namely,” “that is to say,” or “as follows.”** It’s often used in legal, academic, or formal writing to introduce clarification or a specific example. It’s abbreviated as **viz.** (e.g., _He studies the classics—viz., Latin and Greek._) The word comes from a contraction of **videre licet**, meaning “it is permitted to see” or “one may see.”
- Dr. John Ferrier—1761 to 1815—author of an essay towards a theory of apparitions published in 1813 and Dr Samuel Hibbard—1782 to 1848—the author of sketches of the philosophy of apparitions or an attempt to trace such illusions to their physical causes published in 1825—as the subtitle of Hibbetts work indicates both were skeptical about the existence of ghosts

## D-Block-Post-chapter Notes
- I thought Miss Pole hanging the hat in her hallway was super smart
- Love Miss Matty going to bed earlier to get the night over with - there's a very similar moment in Moby Dick Ch 4
- No doubt Signor Brunoni was a Frenchman - HA - Signor
- HA! Some of the more uneductated people thought Carlo died of Apoplexy (HA!) the crazy women thought poison.
- Miss Pole willing to get her TEETH PULLED to get to Mr Hoggins for Intel?!
- Miss Pole's logic is stunninng:  Every mother son of them wishes to be considered Samson and Solomon, rolled into one. Too strong ever to be beaten or discomforted. Two wise ever to be outwitted....My father was a man, and I know the sex pretty well.
	- LOGICAL FALLACY - Miss Pole: "I beleive he was robbed..." - ### **Appeal to Belief**  **(argumentum ad consequentiam or ad populum, depending on tone)**  **Definition**: Claiming that something must be true (or false) simply because one believes it, regardless of the evidence or reasoning. - the plural of anecdote is NOT Data.
- I love Miss Matty's flying leap into bed AND her rolling the ball under the bed. I love her brain!
- Mrs Forester - cold pigged in the morning to get out of bed
