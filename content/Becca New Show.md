    I was thinking while reading your essay back to Steph, that 
    - (a) you’re a genius and 
    - (b) your grace and tact are unparalleled. 
Then I started thinking about how much fun it was to do the Emma livestream with you. Then I started wondering if we could do livestreams regularly. Just us or with other listeners where we talk about more modern books. I’m forever getting pinged with the “Can you do Game of Thrones next?” Sort of thing. It’s an incomplete thought, but it’s a thought that wont go away. ![😉](https://discord.com/assets/4742013cbe7dbca0.svg)

    IDEAS!!! I’ve had requests for ages to do things like “Wolf Hall” on Craft Lit.

7. Obv, no can do AS A REGULAR craftlit book. But! WE could do it (or something like it) without the chapter audio. Schedule Out the chapters and re-hash the previous chunk then pre-hash the next? And/or livestream/video on “Any Other Name” And/Or Gaskell and women’s work/social issues/ the Importance of hearing from other voices (there’s a video I’ll send a link to that got me on this track)

## Discussion Topics 

    Okay, brainstorming a bit. A common thread I'm seeing in not just recent CraftLit content but in conversations we're having here, on Thursdays, and in the discord group, is women's voices and more specifically dynamics between women. A few discussion topics that stem out of that:
    
    - How are women uplifting or failing other women? (the Jameela Al Jamil substack, Cranford),
    - How do women (authors and characters) talk about other women? What traps do they fall into, and how do they surprise us?,
    - How do women authors portray the patriarchy and the ways different women characters navigate it? (Wollstonecraft, Gaskell generally),
    - How do answers to the questions above change depending on what generation is speaking? Can authors like Austen, Gaskell, Eliot, etc. hold up to the scrutiny of modern feminism? Will they always fall into the trap of not answering "everything"? Do they NEED to? Or why do WE require them to?,
    - How does the Bechdel test play into this? It's a modern idea - and certainly one Alison Bechdel never intended to be without nuance - so is it fair to apply it to older works, when women had less ability to separate ANYTHING from male influence? How can you have a conversation that isn't about men in a society where EVERYTHING is about men? And if it's not about men, then is it about hierarchy between women, figuring who's higher in the pecking order _after a man_?,
    
    (edited)
    More questions we could explore
    
    - Who are our favorite feminist authors and why?,
    - Who are some women authors we think fail - or even occasionally stumble - in their writing of women? What might have gotten influenced them and do modern women writers still make those mistakes?,
    - How are modern authors engaging with and reexamining the lives of past women? These could be fictional characters in historical fiction, it could be works like By Any Other Name, which shed light on "forgotten" women.,

    Hell yes!!! I love this—all of these!!!! And we can pull other people into the streams as needed or call for questions/comments from CraftLiteratti if’s useful. Heck—_I’d_ tune in to watch/listen to these!!! 
    
    ***Plus, honestly, the gap between what was expected of “good girls” when I was little vs how girl-raising when you were little could probably fill a dissertation! (How different and which things were largely unchanged) which I think makes it truly useful content/context.***

    OH. ONE MORE IDEA.

## Here’s another topic: 
**how often we saw (and do we still see) women characters who are there to “teach a lesson by their deaths” (before this was largely focused on LGBTQIA characters). Vis this annotation for Cranford ch 12: *"veiled prophet in Lalla Rookh" by Thomas Moore (not that one, one that lived 1799-1852), verse tales joined by prose text, first tale "The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan"* where the beautiful Zelica is lured to a harem & later killed by mistake by her lover...

ROUGH drafts—please alter/edit/polish/or trash. ![🤓](https://discord.com/assets/2e44c929023f5913.svg) 
 - tagline like: What She Said — because we’ve always had something to say. 
 - **Intro** 
	 - **Heather: Welcome to What She Said — a roundtable where we talk about the books that made us, the stories we’re still wrestling with, and the voices we want more of.** 
	 - **Becca: I’m Becca.** 
	 - **Heather: And I’m Heather.** 
	 - Together: And we’re so glad you’re here. 
	 - **Becca: Today we’re diving into [topic] — part literary discussion, part cultural unpacking, part therapy session (let’s be honest).** 
	 - 
	 - ALT Heather: I’m Heather. 
	 - Becca: I’m Becca. 
	 - Together: **And we have notes.** 
	 - Heather: From dead heroines to angry diary entries, we’re digging into the stories that shaped us — for better and worse. 
 - **Outro** 
	 - **Heather: That’s it for this chapter of What She Said — but the conversation doesn’t stop here.** 
	 - **Becca: Share your thoughts in the comments or tell us what book shaped you.**
	 - **Heather: And if you want to keep talking books, feminism, and forgotten voices —** 
	 - **Together: — we’ll be back soon.** 
	 - **Becca: Until then… read on, rage smartly, and be kind to your past selves.** 
		 - ALT Heather: Drop a comment, tell us what lit your literary fuse, or just yell about that one character who still makes you mad. 
		 - Becca: Don’t forget to subscribe, follow, or yell into the void — whichever feels right today.

    I think I prefer the first versions of both intro and outro, but I like "And we have notes" more than "And we're so glad you're here." I don't think we should try speaking together, though. It's a little corny, and the timing could be tricky on a livestream. What do you think of this punch-up to the tagline? 
## **What She Said - Because women have always had something to say.**

    ***Yes! And Andrew just had a really interesting idea. Taking the 19 years of back catalog of audio, what if you occasionally out places in various books where I have a take that is worth revisiting. We use that as fodder for one of our conversations/episodes? Because certainly things have changed since 2006. And it is—I think—important to revisit that stuff and do more than just having me re-record it. I’m thinking especially little women and Herland and maybe even Anne oGG to start?***

## I think we wanted to start with the books that raised us, as a sort of introduction to who we are and how we're approaching these topics/books.

    THAT was it! Excellent!
    
    
    You mentioned the Little House books. I'd definitely talk about Alcott and also the Anne of Green Gables books.

    I have a really big work event Sept. 19, so scheduling that week won't be easy (I might be working late leading up to it). But the two weeks before that should be good.

    Sat/Sun are easiest, ofc, because my time is all my own - my work only has two weekend events every year (next ones are Nov 22 and April 18). For weekdays, Mon/Wed/Thur are generally free from work (though I typically only work a couple Tue/Fri evening events through the year, so those aren't too hard to schedule around either). I'd be okay with the first two weeks of September, if you want to get started! The week of the 19th is technically _possible_, but I know my boss tends to put some things off till the last minute, so I find it's easier to plan for overtime than not, lol.

    This is a good episode, but it's really the last 5 minutes that interest me, when they talk about "what is the opposite of toxic masculinity?" and Judy remembers being told as a little girl that if a boy bullied her it meant he liked her. I think that's something every generation of women up until maybe Gen Z grew up hearing and often believing (at least until they grew up). Could be an interesting point to bring up when we talk about how different generations of girls are raised.
