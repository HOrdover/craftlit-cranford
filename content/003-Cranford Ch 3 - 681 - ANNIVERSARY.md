- 19:20 Hortus Siccus - an arranged collection of dried plants
- 21:19 [Judi Dench as Miss Matty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974077/characters/nm0001132) in the miniseries

- 26:33 [Bluebeard](https://sites.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault03.html) by Charles Perrault: 
	- **Moral:** Curiosity, in spite of its appeal, often leads to deep regret. To the displeasure of many a maiden, its enjoyment is short lived. Once satisfied, it ceases to exist, and always costs dearly. 
	- **Another moral:** Apply logic to this grim story, and you will ascertain that it took place many years ago. No husband of our age would be so terrible as to demand the impossible of his wife, nor would he be such a jealous malcontent. For, whatever the color of her husband's beard, the wife of today will let him know who the master is. ***(Heather's note: I just had to add those here as I found them after I recorded)***

Another tale by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm about a sinister bridegroom (Aarne-Thompson type 955).—The [Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/folk_and_myth/indices) is wrapped around the Bluebeard story like a tourniquet!
- 27:50 "Leave me to repose..." from poem ["The Descent of Odin"](https://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o4986-w0260.shtml)  by Thomas Gray (of ["Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard"](https://www.thomasgray.org/texts/poems/elcc))
- 29:00 "Pride which apes humility" from "The Devil's Thoughts"
	- "The Devil's Thoughts" is a satirical poem in common metre by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, published in 1799, *and expanded by Robert Southey* in 1827 and retitled "The Devil's Walk" *(Heather: AH HA! Now it makes sense)*. The narrative describes the Devil going walking and enjoying the sight of the various sins of mankind. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil's_Thoughts) Originally published: 1799 Authors: [Robert Southey](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0c1395bd2e2481ba&sxsrf=AHTn8zrV4nGQDbh-4vYNAEQzVtfbQTj39Q:1744140144360&q=Robert+Southey&si=APYL9bu1Sl4M4TWndGcDs6ZL5WJXWNYEL_kgEEwAe0iMZIocdZIhbjKZKp0dKL5P_2_9oJrUMAhjca-zJfpZuodIX9iIDEMPSQvuoTUaPJKsSBz3X_aBBp1_le6K1ykaFjRPNfOrnzhggvl88am-5qqAuaE1aYfz-pzQ15oOhjfzrvHTy6yeWL8lfIADQ4G_VoC4tJfoN3LRB9y5PILwYk32Zya1HpFR0stwEfPtBSrgip_0ofh2NAsFEyw5AQGMlEVvUtCiidfs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiv1fitlMmMAxUsEVkFHSVkCZUQmxMoAHoECBoQAg), [Samuel Taylor Coleridge](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0c1395bd2e2481ba&sxsrf=AHTn8zrV4nGQDbh-4vYNAEQzVtfbQTj39Q:1744140144360&q=Samuel+Taylor+Coleridge&si=APYL9bu1Sl4M4TWndGcDs6ZL5WJXWNYEL_kgEEwAe0iMZIocdfKSb5jjcFQL_-_gYRC5aTVNQD9tu4AH0-9nXv1gV7wVLp2ko5NfP-jWW3AAgtjlNQ12y3-E1r1CYjl8wY0Dj0dMOlwFMtyvsoE1cdiBQ26PMltv_eUN7pMq4sWNCGLYqbYtwtJU7jyz-O_dj7mMw7llUlmv99A6jPmMWsYAYLCdV8ENdIC9_5Txk8wgvbV_DEAeWIHLqwZwhS4o2bonu9mSGF5AfrnEUfOD90Y7P4TKYWdh1A%3D%3D&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiv1fitlMmMAxUsEVkFHSVkCZUQmxMoAXoECBoQAw)

- Serve from the Left details:
  - **Serving:**
        - **Plates:** Plates are served from the left, using your left hand to place the plate, allowing the server to use their right hand to avoid crossing in front of the guest. 
    - **Beverages:** Beverages, such as water and wine, are poured from the right, as glasses are typically placed to the right of the guest's plate. 
        - **Sides:** Sides like bread and vegetables are also served from the left. 
- **Clearing:**
    - **Plates:** Plates are cleared from the right, using your right hand to remove the plate. 
- **Exceptions:**
    - If a guest is obstructing the way on the right, or if there is an object on the right side, a server may need to serve from the right. 
    - Some restaurants may have their own protocols for serving, whether it's to the right or left. 
- **Why Serve from the Left?**
    - Serving from the left is considered less intrusive for right-handed diners, as it avoids the server having to reach across the guest. 
    - It also allows the server to carry the food in their left hand and serve with their right hand, without crossing their arms in front of the guest.
