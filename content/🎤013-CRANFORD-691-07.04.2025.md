- 10:45 **Korean thimbles:** I cobbled together a way to do it by combining [this](http://theconstantcrafter.blogspot.com/2011/12/bojagi-korean-quilting-class_22.html), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HandSew/comments/1j96vc9/cloth_thimble_tutorial/?chainedPosts=t3_1j54s41%2Ct3_1j96vc9), and [this](https://www.instructables.com/An-Scrappy-Version-of-a-Korean-Thimble/). ==Aldrin-I have video of this and the raffle book(s) here in the Dropbox--https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dukfpbx65ffk26jwayt9g/Korean-Thimble-and-July-Aug-Sept-Book-video.MP4?rlkey=cnlkotjnqzeg2oys8bpsxd3rw&dl=0 - however the thimble photo you found is perfect, ignore my video!==
- 13:00 **Knit Nation** - I got the first three issues…I’ll let you know.
- 14:20 I also stumbled on an interesting Hogarth video that includes a bit on the Rake’s Progress which I mentioned several weeks ago: https://youtube.com/watch?v=GTg9CzvNWvw&si=9Tx4jwObCk5VLrYB 
- 15:00 Here's the [*Washington Post* review of *Frankenstein* at STC](https://wapo.st/4lAUZev) and I THINK this is a gift link so you can read it without an account!

## B-Block-BOOK TALK—Re-hash Notes
Last week we had our little setting-up-the-chess board chapter; this week we begin our final arc.


***POLL QUESTION - there are several other Cranford-adjacent stories that E Gaskell wrote - would you like me to do those right after we’re done with Cranford?*** 

## **KALL8 Calls**
## 19:20 Pre-hash Notes

- 19:30 welly stawed = well-stopped or well-stuffed
- 21:30 Shawl - 30 shillings (machine made) which would be £1.10 using historical economic calculators (e.g., the UK National Archives or measuringworth.com):
		**- 30 shillings in 1845 ≈ £85–£120 today (2025 GBP)**  depending on the method (retail price index vs. average earnings).

## 25:20 C-Block Book Audio / 
## 55:55 Post-chapter Notes

- Annotations said “green tea was FERMENTED tea” - nope, just [***partially* oxidized** ](https://artfultea.com/blogs/tea-wisdom/tea-oxidation?srsltid=AfmBOoqxzeR5RcBtiBz5RduuUoLLPN-zOwOZCdOSl1T3py1IaSyJS36W) then the process was halted, whereas Black teas were FULLY oxidized.
