## B-Block-BOOK TALK—Re-hash Notes
Last week we had our little setting-up-the-chess board chapter; this week we begin our final arc.


***QUESTION - there are several other Cranford-adjacent stories that E Gaskell wrote - would you like me to do those right after we’re done with Cranford?*** 

## **KALL8 Calls**
## Pre-hash Notes

- welly stawed = well-stopped or well-stuffed
- for Americans - the Dole 
- We spoke last time about bonds and the South Sea Bubble. If you watched that, this week’s chapter might make even more sense to you….XXXXXXX (this week may also help explain why Mr Banks was right about the importance of being a good Bank Man, a steward of other people’s money)
B) What rate did banks pay out on average for keeping your money with them?
Typical interest rates for deposit accounts in 1850 England ranged from 2% to 3.5%, depending on the type of account.
				In summary:
				➡️ Interest rates for savers were modest, roughly 2%–3.5%, generally lower than returns from investment.
				➡️ Security, not high yield, was the priority — but ironically, true security was still elusive outside of the major institutions.
	
	After the Bank Charter Act of 1844, the frequency and nature of bank panics in England changed, but they did not stop entirely. The Act aimed to bring more stability to the financial system, and it did help—but it also introduced new tensions.
	🔹 Key Bank Panics and Crises After 1844:
	1. Panic of 1847
	- Cause: Over-speculation in railways (“Railway Mania”) and a sharp contraction in credit.
	- Effect: Numerous bank failures and a severe liquidity crunch.
	- Resolution: The Bank of England temporarily suspended the Bank Charter Act, allowing it to issue more notes than the Act permitted. This calmed the crisis.
	- Lesson: The Act’s rigidity made the situation worse until it was suspended.

- Shawl - 30 shillings (machine made) which would be 30 shillings (£1.10)” reflects the pre-decimal currency system used in Britain before 1971 when   
		
		- £1 = 20 shillings (s)
		- So:  
		    30 shillings = £1 and 10 shillings  
		    ✅ Written as: £1 10s or £1.10s
		    Using historical economic calculators (e.g., the UK National Archives or measuringworth.com):
		**- 30 shillings in 1845 ≈ £85–£120 today (2025 GBP)**,  
		    depending on the method (retail price index vs. average earnings).
		B. Relative labor value
		- A skilled tradesman in 1840s England might earn 20–30s per week, so a 30s shawl was about one week’s skilled wages.
		- That could be £500–£700 per week today, so the shawl’s “value” in terms of labor cost might be more like £500+.
		- in 1840 a SKILLED ARTISAN might make 30 shillings/week in silver

- BANK NOTES - remember Count of Monte Cristo and how many steps the Count had to go through to get an unlimited line of credit from an English bank in order to have that line-of-credit from Danglars - THOSE BANK NOTES (closer to promissory note that was REDEEMABLE for COIN) are what you’re going to hear about in today’s chapter. Paying in Sterling or Gold was safer for shops. in 1833 THEBANK CHARTER ACT made BofE notes over 5pounds legal tender in England and Wales (not Scotland or Ireland) 
- a SOVEREIGN coin was   
	- official British currency, worth exactly £1 sterling.
	- So a sovereign was both a gold coin and one pound sterling in value.
- PORCELAIN FALSE TEETH were available in 1820

## C-Block Book Audio / 
## D-Block Post-chapter Notes

- Miss Jenkyn’s lack of patience with the postman - and v generous gift of a shilling and mince-pie to each kid! along with her “glorious opportunity for giving advice and benefiting her fellow-ceratures.
- Mary S - my letter from my father was “just a man’s letter…I mean it was very dull and gave no information beyond that he was well, it had rained, trade was stagnant and there wweere disagreeable rumours afloat.
- Town and County Bank paid EIGHT PERcent??! IS THAT NORMAL??? NO IT IS NOT~~~
	- 
	- A) How stable were local banks in 1850 England? Mixed, and often precarious.Key points:
		- Country banks (i.e., rural/local banks) were not very stable, especially prior to reforms in the 1840s. Many had small reserves and were vulnerable to economic shocks or runs.
		- Banking panics occurred frequently in the early 19th century (notably in 1825, when nearly 100 country banks failed).
		- The Bank Charter Act of 1844 started to limit note-issuing and gave the Bank of England more control, which stabilized the system somewhat over the following years.
		- After 1844, banks that already issued banknotes could continue, but no new ones could start — and if a note-issuing bank merged or failed, its right to issue notes lapsed.
		- Still, failures continued sporadically, and confidence was often tied to reputation rather than regulation.
				In summary:
				➡️ London banks were more stable.
				➡️ Country banks could be risky, especially if small and under-capitalized.
				➡️ Post-1844 reforms brought more stability, but not full security by modern standards.

- “We were to buy the tea, select the silk, and then clamber up the iron corkscrew stairs that led into what was once a loft, though now a Fashion show-room.” - this is aspirational architecture, however, Dianne and I visited a button shop in York that was - I beleive - four stories and dated from ___ so it’s certainly plausible,; these shops were similar to modern Department Stores - not Selfridges, but not a Woolworths 5-and-dime, either. the LOFT would have been small and aspirationally named.
- Annotations said “green tea was FERMENTED tea” - nope, just ***partially* oxidized** then the process was halted, whereas Black teas were FULLY oxidized.

- Miss Matty’s acknowledgement of her dream of multiple dresses is handled so gently - it would be so hard to care for them…it makes the total loss that much more painful.
- Matty’s fluster at not being able to explain the ethics of her decision to help the shawl-buyer - MOOD. “I am quite cleaer about it in my own mind; but, you know, I can never speak quite as conprehensibly as others can.” PLUS her “I’ll wait to buy silk, PERHAPS YOU WILL THEN HAVE A GREATER CHOICE….” LOVE her!!!!
- love miss pole - coming in without her teeth!!!!
- Fatigue of body (which was, in fact, depression of mind)—MOOD
- Miss Matty’s starting one direction, then switching “I was very thankful TO—I was very thankful, THAT I saw my duty this morning.…”
- WHAT THIS MEANS TO MISS MATTY: Using MeasuringWorth (https://measuringworth.com) and estimates for 1840-to-2025:
A. Purchasing Power (Retail Price Index)
- £149.66 in 1840 ≈ £18,000–£20,000 in 2025
- £13.00 in 1840 ≈ £1,500–£1,750 in 2025
B. Relative Income (Average Earnings)
- £149.66 in 1840 ≈ £120,000–£140,000 today
- £13.00 in 1840 ≈ £10,500–£12,000
This second method reflects the standard of living or social class purchasing ability—what it felt like to lose that income.

I LOVE MISS MATTY
- ‘I am not crying for myself, dear,’ said she, wiping them away; ‘I believe I am crying for the very silly thought, of how my mother would grieve if she could know—she always cared for us so much more than for herself. But many a poor person has less; and I am not very extravagant, and, thank God, when the neck of mutton, and Martha’s wages, and the rent, are paid, I have not a farthing owing. Poor Martha! I think she’ll be sorry to leave me.’ Miss Matty smiled at me through her tears, and she would fain have had me see only the smile, not the tears.

		Here are some fascinating period insights into how green tea—and tea in general—was presented and discussed in England around the mid-19th century:
		
		1. Tea’s Marketing and Domestic Image
		Advertisements and writings from the 1840s–1860s often emphasized tea as a wholesome, “domestic delight”—a key feature of middle‑class Victorian life:
		- A popular 1840s ad poem (“A Fireside Chat”, published at Edward Bell’s Tea Warehouse) described the scene as “snug,” with “kitten, kettle, husband, child and wife” all cozy around teatime—suggesting tea was an integral part of family harmony.
		- Horniman’s Pure Tea (circa 1863) explicitly touted itself as “pure” and sold only in packet form, reflecting consumer fears of adulteration and reinforcing an image of safety and quality  .
		Although these ads are slightly later, the trend of promoting tea as wholesome, clean, and suitable for domestic display was already firmly established by 1850.
		2. Green Tea Was Still Accentuated as Special
		Through the late 18th and early 19th centuries, green tea remained a prized variety, prized for fine Chinese imports like Hyson, Imperial, and congou:
		- A tea‑culture guide from 1730 noted green tea grades and valued the delicacy of Hyson and “Imperial” green leaf  .
		- While by 1850 black tea was rising in popularity, green tea remained part of the common repertoire, especially among those seeking quality or health‑conscious options ().
		Hence, even in Cranford’s time, green tea would have been familiar—and likely regarded as “refined.”
		3. Tea as Ritual—and the Role of Green Tea
		Tea in Victorian England had become more than a drink; it was a ritual and a sign of respectability:
		- Social guides and household manuals from the mid-19th century stressed the significance of regimented teatimes, elegant tablewares like caddies and fine china, and the etiquette around service  .
		- Even though black tea was more widespread, green tea retained a niche position in such ritualistic presentations for its perceived elegance.
		🧭 Conclusion
		- By 1850, green tea was:  
		   1. Commonly available in Cheshire and other market towns.
		2. Marketed as a pure, fine-quality product in the same vein as black tea but often associated with refinement.
		3. Part of domestic tea rituals, stored in caddies and served with care in genteel households.
		Although specific mid‑1850s ads for green tea are rarer, the period’s focus on purity (to ward off adulteration) and ritual highlights how green tea would have been understood and consumed at the time.

- Some prices (flour, walnuts, education) are derived from broader historical records and contextual Victorian patterns.
- Items like shawls (20–40s), kettles (4–8s), chests of drawers (25–40s), schooling (20–30s) are informed estimates consistent with known mid‑19th c. price ranges.
- The novel price (31s 6d) is based on typical three-volume first editions of the 1840s.
