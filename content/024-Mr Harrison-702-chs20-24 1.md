Thank you being a constant source of inspiration ❤️

- BUYER BEWARE: 
	- I'll have links to everything I mention in the shownotes, so you can do your own dives if you like.
	- I want to tell you a story of my last five days, and then give you a CTA at the end. I'll provide you with all the materials you might need, so you won't have to do anything beyond talking to your friends and family—unless you want to ;) 
	- several frustrating things happened to me in the last five days and the frustration all had a similar cause. While looking for documents, instruction books, pattern, books, manuals,  I kept finding/being recommended what is colloquially being referred to as AI slop. 
	- But where it really started was when the YouTube algorithm served me a video with a very compelling picture and click-bait-y title. I'd never seen something that appeared to be a Victorian Photograph where the video maker had done the research to source who was in one of those photos and why it was taken.
		- The short version: I still haven't.
		- It took about 10 min before I started to wonder and 14 minutes before I started checking comments. One lone poster kept saying "the story isn't real... it's fiction... not real history, do a Google search..."
	- Then over the weekend I was looking for tatting patterns—both new and historical. Lately I've started paying more attention to reviews on book sale sites and the extra minutes invested in that paid off this time.
		- I saw prices from 2.97 to 30 for Paper copies of texts and in the $30 instance, it had a kindle version for $27. 
			- That's a clue that something's wrong.
			- Another clue: one book was on Amazon from "Unknown Publisher"
			- But the one that made me dive deep was a book, allegedly from 1888, $2.97 for an ebook download, not on amazon, only on the website. How did I find it? PINTEREST. == NEED LINK TO HOW TO ESCAPE PINTEREST LINKS ON GOOGLE==
			- Pinterest sent me to the publisher's page, I could tell something was fishy. But I wasn't getting anywhere with doing my own research. I knew something was wrong, I just couldn't figure out what it was.
				- So Here's the thing I learned about AI slop, one of the fastest, and best ways to find out if some thing is a Slop, is to ask AI.
				- I'll share the response I got from CHAT GPT so you can see it's response, BUT—I've spent months training my Chatbot to only respond with verifyable information—if it can't provide links and sources, I don't want it to give me an answer. GPT has a mission to ALWAYS HAVE AN ANSWER—that means it will make one up if it can't find one. I've had to ***train*** mine to say "I didn't find a direct answer to that, but here's what I DID find..."
		- I've mentioned before, the Garbage in/Garbage out directive of audio recording. It's true for AI, too. If you frame your question poorly, you'll get a marginally useful answer. (HINT: once you DO get a useful response, ask the ChatBot how you SHOULD have phrased the question at the outset)
			-   You CAN INSTRUCT CHAT GPT to "respond like a college researcher, with links, verifiable dates, and accurate details. If you find none, tell me that."
	- However, I know not everyone wants to invest the time and hassle into doing that. Instead, when you find AI Slop — if on YouTube, give the video or post a thumbs-down and add a comment like "AI Slop?"—not accusing, just raising the spectre.
		- If you can mark a video "uninterested" or "don't show me again"—do that. 
		- Share the lousy site or Slop channel or scam product on your social media with a "This is AI SLop—do not spend money here" and use #aislop  so it's easy to find all the posts with that tag
		- These SAME things can be done in various ways on Facebook, Instagram, and ==PINTEREST!??!?!!?!?==
	- I'll be spending the rest of my week rounding up sources for how to spot this garbage and how to respond, how to detach from as many algorithmic feeds as possible, and I'll put that all on my substack—which I'll link back to from the shownotes.
		- I know I've said this over and over, but I'll say it again for our younger listeners—back before Serial showed the world what Podcasts were and showed corporations how much money they could make from them, people had blogs. Just normal people. They wrote about and documented with pictures and instructions the nifty things they did. The bar for entry was low and you could find AMAZING things—usually by following a blogger's BlogRoll.
			- That means, if you only ever found new bloggers via the blogs of people you already trusted, you were rarely (if ever) going to be disappointed with the content you were consuming.
	- EVERY TIME we get lazy and let an Algorithm decide what we should watch or see next, we're letting go of that control a little bit more.
- I'm seriously concerned about people one generation older than I am who only just learned that Nigerian Princes don't generally need to do some complex banking with ***them***. It's going to get worse. 
	- As part of the CraftLiteratti, I hope that you—like me—go to your public libraries and offer to host a meet-up—not a class, you don't have to prepare anything more than what I'll put in the shownotes for you. Just go, be there, be kind, and let people come ask you if something is safe. Your goal isn't to tell them yes or no—your goal is to show them all the ways that THEY can find out for themselves.
	- Because it isn't only BUYER BEWARE—it's SANITY Beware—it won't take many times of being hoodwinked before everyone stops trusting everything. It's one of the reasons you'll notice CraftLit adding "never AI" tags to episodes and social media posts.
- AND because I hate ending on a downer, here's something I stumbled on (on a blog) that I ordered and it DOES work: THIMTEC - thimble tape. Can I use it to push very tiny needles through very tight fabrics? Nope. Can I use it when I'm handsewing in general? YES! Far fewer sore fingertips at the end of the day. Can it help grip needles when you pull it through? YES! - though FINGER COTS still work best. THe THimtec doesn't tear - so you'll need scissors and I found that one 10"/25cm piece to start was fine, but adding another layer in a more targeted location made this VERY useful. Circuclation was find.

## From CHAT GPT:
*I’ll break this into two parts: first what I found about the book you mentioned, and second a draft of how you might explain to your audience how to spot “AI-slop” or dubious books/videos masquerading as genuine historical or craft resources*
*⸻*
#### ***1. What I found on the title and publisher***

***Title: The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete Guide to the Work‑Table (Sixth Edition, 1888)***
	*• Yes — there is a book titled The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete Guide to the Work-Table (or very similar) dating to the 1880s. For example, the version “Second Edition” is listed with publisher E. Harrison, London, 1885.*  
	*• Archive.org hosts a digitised version: “The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete Guide to the Work-Table: Containing Instructions in Berlin Work, Crochet, Drawn-Thread Work, Embroidery, Knitting, Knotting or Macrame, Lace, Netting, Poonah Painting, & Tatting, with numerous illustrations and coloured designs” — London : E. Harrison.*  
	*• Catalogue info: HathiTrust shows “The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete guide to the worktable : containing instructions in Berlin work … & tatting, with numerous illustrations and coloured designs.” Publisher stated as London : E. Harrison.*  
	*• An entry shows the Sixth Edition (1888) being re-published (modern print or Kindle perhaps) by “Romantic English” website.*  

***Publisher(s)***
	*• Original 19th-c edition: The publisher is given as **E. Harrison (London)**.*   
	*• I did not locate a legitimate historical publisher named “Romance English” (or “romance, English”) in the context of an 1888 craft book. The site selling the Sixth Edition uses “Romantic English” as a modern publisher/distributor website (likely a re-print or marketing imprint) rather than the original 1888 imprint.*  
	*• Therefore: the title is very likely genuine (a Victorian craft manual) and published originally by E. Harrison in 1888 (or earlier). But the “publisher, romance, English” does not appear to be an original historical publisher of the 1888 edition; it’s likely a modern re-print imprint or website name.*
	
***Conclusion for part 1***
	*• ✔ The text appears authentic: the 1880s edition (Sixth Edition 1888) is real.*
	*• ✘ The publisher you quoted (“romance, English”) does not appear to correspond to the original publisher; the original is E. Harrison (London).*
	*• ✔ So you can safely point out the book exists and is real, but you’ll want to clarify accurately: “Originally published by E. Harrison (London) in 1888” rather than “Romance English”.*
*⸻*

#### ***2. How to explain to your audience how to spot AI-scam books/videos***

*Here’s a draft outline and some language you could use on your podcast to help listeners/viewers identify suspicious content — especially when it claims to be historical or craft-authentic but may be manufactured, misleading or AI-generated. You can adapt this to your tone on CraftLit.*

##### ***a) Why this matters***

*• Because AI tools (and mass-digitisation + algorithmic generation of metadata) make it very easy for items to look legitimate: correct-format title, historical date, vintage-looking cover, “edition 1888” etc.*

*• But authenticity requires more: verifiable publisher, edition, provenance, library/catalogue records.*

*• If a video or book claims to be “based on a text from 1888” (for example) and uses that as authority, you want to check carefully.*

*• As you noted, one video presented as historical fact may actually be fictional or heavily embellished, yet comments show people accepting it as real — that’s the risk: misinformation embedded in “craft” or “historical” guise.*

##### ***b) What to look for: Red flags & verification steps***

### *Here are practical checks you can tell your audience:*

 #### ***Red flags***

1. ***Mismatch of publisher/date/edition***
*• A book claims “Sixth Edition 1888” but the publisher named doesn’t exist or cannot be traced historically.*
*• The imprint is vague (e.g., “Romance English” rather than a known historical publisher).*
*• The edition number (sixth) but no records of earlier editions or clear lineage.*

2. ***Modern re-print with mismatched metadata***
*• A modern seller reprints an old title but the imprint and metadata are changed or ambiguous.*
*• The “new” book claims to be 1888 but may be a “facsimile” or marketing version — not the original.*
*• The text inside may not clearly indicate original vs modern edits.*

3. ***Over-dramatic or sensational video/book that claims “forgotten history”***
*• Video says “Untold story of Victorian women’s craft” and uses the title as evidence — but the source is unsupported.*
*• Comments affirming the “sad true story” although evidence is thin or absent.*
*• One user tries to correct (“it’s fiction…”) yet the crowd accepts it.*

4. ***Absence of credible library catalogue or archival record***
*• Major library catalogues (HathiTrust, WorldCat, etc) don’t list the edition or publisher.*
*• No DOI, no stable academic citation, only commercial print on demand listing.*

5. ***Too perfect packaging / “nice old cover” but no provenance***
*• A seller displays a Victorian-style cover, but the interior or description shows modern design or no page scans.*
*• The description uses marketing buzz (“Victorian crafting masterpiece”) rather than bibliographic detail.*


### ***Verification steps***

If it's TOO awful or TOO good a deal or TOO perfect—be suspicious.

1. ***Check library/catalogue records***
*• Search for the exact title in HathiTrust, WorldCat, Google Books, Archive.org. In your case: found on HathiTrust as “The Young Ladies’ Journal Complete guide to the work-table” with E. Harrison, 1885.*  
*• Check edition number, publisher, date.*

2. ***Check for earlier editions / publisher history***
*• If “Sixth Edition, 1888” is claimed, look for the first edition or previous editions (2nd edition 1885 exists per The Met record).*  
*• Does the publisher exist historically? E. Harrison does; “Romance English” appears not.*

3. ***Inspect inside the text / scan if available***
*• Does the preface/intro mention the edition number, date, publisher? For this book: Preface dated London, January 1888.*  
*• Are the illustrations, coloured designs credible for the era?*

4. ***Check modern editions vs original***
*• If you purchase a new print saying “Sixth Edition 1888”, check imprint: is it simply re-published by a modern press (which should say so) or is it claiming original printing?*
*• Sellers often say “facsimile reprint” or “modern edition” — if they don’t, be cautious.*

5. ***Be cautious with videos or books that use historical titles to anchor a narrative***
*• If a video claims “Based on the 1888 manual by The Young Ladies’ Journal” and then weaves a “true story” about a tragic Victorian craftsperson, check whether the manual actually mentions that story.*

*• Ask: where is the archival reference? Which pages? Are there citations? Are images authentic?*

***c) Practical “checklist” you can share***

## *Here’s a quick checklist you could provide:*

*• Title exactly matches a known historical work (with catalog proof).*

*• Edition number and date are verifiable via library records.*

*• Publisher imprint is historically real (or clearly a reprint).*

*• The edition claims vs actual content match (scans show date, preface, etc).*

*• The work inside includes primary craft instructions, not just narration of invented drama.*

*• The video/book gives the source of its information (page numbers, archive links).*

*• The narrative (especially if dramatic) is supported by original sources or clearly labelled as speculation/fiction.*

*• Seller/creator discloses if it is a modern reprint or modern adaptation of a historical work.*

*• If price is very low and claims “rare 1888 edition” but packaging looks brand-new without protective mentions, be cautious (possible print-on-demand).*

  

***e) Why this matters for your domain (craft + historical accuracy)***

*• For historic craft like shuttle tatting, companion planting, Victorian needlework — **the value lies in authenticity:** patterns, nomenclature, technical instructions used at the time. If a work is fabricated or mis-attributed, you’re chasing ghosts, not genuine tradition.*

*• When creators pull from “AI generated” or loosely verified sources, the instructions may be inaccurate, terminology may be off, and the scene gets distorted (e.g., a video claiming “Victorian women used this exact method in 1888 …” when that method wasn’t documented then).*

*• For your audience (gardeners, craft-people, history buffs) you have credibility by pointing out how to evaluate sources. This reinforces your preference for original sources and unmodernised editions (which you already hold as a principle).*

*• In the context of a podcast episode about the problem of AI-scam books/videos, you can use the shuttle tatting example: you spent two hours, found repeated false claims, discovered a historical source but many videos mis-represent it, etc. That gives a concrete case study.*

### CHAPTER XV

'About this time there was a **sale at Ashmeadow,** a pretty house in the neighbourhood of Duncombe. It was likewise an easy walk, and the spring days tempted many people thither, who had no intention of buying anything, but who liked the idea of rambling through the woods, gay with early primroses and wild daffodils, and of seeing the gardens and house, which till now had been shut up from the ingress of the townspeople. Mrs. Rose had planned to go, but an unlucky cold prevented her. She begged me to bring her a very particular account, saying she delighted in details, and always questioned Mr. Rose as to the side-dishes of the dinners to which he went. The late Mr. Rose's conduct was always held up as a model to me, by the way. I walked to Ashmeadow, pausing or loitering with different parties of townspeople, all bound in the same direction. At last I found the Vicar and Sophy, and with them I stayed. I sat by Sophy and talked and listened. A sale is a very pleasant gathering after all. The auctioneer, in a country place, is privileged to joke from his rostrum, and, having a personal knowledge of most of the people, can sometimes make a very keen hit at their circumstances, and turn the laugh against them. For instance, on the present occasion, there was a farmer present, with his wife, who was notoriously the grey mare. The auctioneer was selling some horse-cloths, and called out to recommend the article to her, telling her, with a knowing look at the company, that they would make her a dashing pair of trousers, if she was in want of such an article. She drew herself up with dignity, and said, "Come, John, we've had enough of this." Whereupon there was a burst of laughter, and in the midst of it John meekly followed his wife out of the place. The furniture in the sitting-rooms was, I believe, very beautiful, but I did not notice it much. Suddenly I heard the auctioneer speaking to me, "Mr. Harrison, won't you give me a bid for this table?"

'It was a very pretty little table of walnut-wood. I thought it would go into my study very well, so I gave him a bid. **I saw Miss Horsman bidding against me, so I went off with a full force,** and at last it was knocked down to me. The auctioneer smiled, and congratulated me.

'"A most useful present for Mrs. Harrison, when that lady comes.

'Everybody laughed. They like a joke about marriage; it is so easy to comprehend. But the table which I had thought was for writing, turned out to be a work-table, scissors and thimble complete. No wonder I looked foolish. Sophy was not looking at me, that was one comfort. She was busy arranging a nosegay of wood-anemone and wild sorrel.

'Miss Horsman came up, with her curious eyes.

'"I had no idea things were far enough advanced for you to be purchasing a work-table, Mr. Harrison.

'I laughed off my awkwardness.

'" Did not you, Miss Horsman? You are very much behindhand. You have not heard of my piano, then?"

'"No, indeed," she said, half uncertain whether I was serious or not. "Then it seems there is nothing wanting but the lady."

'"Perhaps she may not be wanting either," said I; for I wished to perplex her keen curiosity.

### CHAPTER XVI

'When I got home from my round, I found Mrs. Rose in some sorrow.

'"Miss Horsman called after you left," said she. "**Have you heard how John Brouncker is at Highport?"**

'"Very well," replied I. "I called on his wife just now, and she had just got a letter from him. She had been anxious about him, for she had not heard for a week. However, all's right now; and she has pretty well enough of work, at Mrs. Munton's, as her servant is ill. Oh, they'll do, never fear."

'"At Mrs. Munton's? Oh, that accounts for it, then. She is so deaf, and makes such blunders.

'"Accounts for what?" said I.

'"Oh, perhaps I had better not tell you," hesitated Mrs. Rose.

'"Yes, tell me at once. I beg your pardon, but I hate mysteries."

'"You are so like my poor dear Mr. Rose. He used to speak to me just in that sharp, cross way. It is only that Miss Horsman called. **She had been making a collection for John Brouncker's widow and - "**

'"But the man's alive!" said I.

'"So it seems. But Mrs. Munton had told her that he was dead. And she has got Mr. Morgan's name down at the head of the list, and Mr. Bullock's."

'Mr. Morgan and I had got into a short, cool way of speaking to each other ever since we had differed so much about the treatment of Brouncker's arm; and I had heard once or twice of his shakes of the head over John's case. He would not have spoken against my method for the world, and fancied that he concealed his fears.

'"Miss Horsman is very ill-natured, I think," sighed forth Mrs. Rose.

'I saw that something had been said of which I had not heard, for the mere fact of collecting money for the widow was good-natured, whoever did it; so I asked, quietly, what she had said.

'"Oh, I don't know if I should tell you. I only know she made me cry; for I'm not well, and I can't bear to hear any one that I live with abused."

'Come! this was pretty plain.

'"What did Miss Horsman say of me?" asked I, half laughing, for I knew there was no love lost between us.

'"Oh, she only said she wondered you could go to sales, and spend your money there, when your ignorance had made Jane Brouncker a widow, and her children fatherless."

'"Pooh! pooh! John's alive, and likely to live as long as you or I, thanks to you, Mrs. Rose."

'When my work-table came home, Mrs. Rose was so struck with its beauty and completeness, and I was so much obliged to her for her identification of my interests with hers, and the kindness of her whole conduct about John, that I begged her to accept of it. She seemed very much pleased; and, after a few apologies, she consented to take it, and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the front parlour, where she usually sat. There was a good deal of morning calling in Duncombe after the sale, and during this time the fact of John being alive was established to the conviction of all except Miss Horsman, who, I believe, still doubted. **I myself told Mr. Morgan, who immediately went to reclaim his money; saying to me that he was thankful for the information; he was truly glad to hear it; and he shook me warmly by the hand for the first time for a month.**

### CHAPTER XVII

'A few days after the sale, I was in the consulting-room. The servant must have left the folding-doors a little ajar, I think. Mrs. Munton came to call on Mrs. Rose; and the former being deaf, I heard all the speeches of the latter lady, as she was obliged to speak very loud in order to be heard. She began:

'"This is a great pleasure, Mrs. Munton, so seldom as you are well enough to go out."

**'Mumble, mumble, mumble,** through the door.

'"Oh, very well, thank you. Take this seat, and then you can admire my new work-table, ma'am; a present from Mr. Harrison."

'Mumble, mumble.

'"Who could have told you, ma'am? Miss Horsman? Oh, yes, I showed it Miss Horsman."

'Mumble, mumble.

'"I don't quite understand you, ma'am."

'Mumble, mumble.

'"I'm not blushing, I believe. I really am quite in the dark as to what you mean."

'Mumble, mumble.

'"Oh, yes, Mr. Harrison and I are most comfortable together. He reminds me so of my dear Mr. Rose - just as fidgety and anxious in his profession."

'Mumble, mumble.

'"I'm sure you are joking now, ma'am" Then I heard a pretty loud:

'"Oh, no;" mumble, mumble, mumble, for a long time.

'"Did he really? Well, I'm sure I don't know. I should be sorry to think he was doomed to be unfortunate in so serious an affair; but you know my undying regard for the late Mr. Rose."

'Another long mumble.

'"You're very kind, I'm sure. Mr. Rose always thought more of my happiness than his own" - a little crying - "but the turtle-dove has always been my ideal, ma'am"

'Mumble, mumble.

'"No one could have been happier than I. As you say, it is a compliment to matrimony."

'Mumble.

'"Oh, but you must not repeat such a thing! Mr. Harrison would not like it. He can't bear to have his affairs spoken about."

'Then there was a change of subject; an inquiry after some poor person, I imagine. I heard Mrs. Rose say:

**'"She has got a mucous membrane, I'm afraid, ma'am."**

'A commiserating mumble.

'"Not always fatal. I believe Mr. Rose knew some cases that lived for years after it was discovered that they had a mucous membrane." A pause. Then Mrs. Rose spoke in a different tone.

'"Are you sure, ma'am, there is no mistake about what he said?"

'Mumble,

'"Pray don't be so observant, Mrs. Munton; you find out too much. One can have no little secrets."

'The call broke up; and I heard Mrs. Munton say in the passage, "I wish you joy, ma'am, with all my heart. There's no use denying it; for I've seen all along what would happen."

'When I went in to dinner, I said to Mrs. Rose:

'"You've had Mrs. Munton here, I think. Did she bring any news?" To my surprise, she bridled and simpered, and replied, "Oh, you must not ask, Mr. Harrison; such foolish reports."

'I did not ask, as she seemed to wish me not, and I knew there were silly reports always about. Then I think she was vexed that I did not ask. Altogether she went on so strangely that I could not help looking at her; and then she took up a hand-screen, and held it between me and her. I really felt rather anxious.

'"Are you not feeling well?" said I innocently.

'"Oh, thank you, I believe I'm quite well; only the room is rather warm, is it not?"

'"Let me put the blinds down for you? the sun begins to have a good deal of power." I drew down the blinds.

'"You are so attentive, Mr. Harrison. Mr. Rose himself never did more for my little wishes than you do."

'"I wish I could do more - I wish I could show you how much I feel" - her kindness to John Brouncker, I was going on to say; but I was just then called out to a patient. Before I went I turned back, and said:

'"Take care of yourself, my dear Mrs. Rose; you had better rest a little."

'"For your sake, I will," said she tenderly.

'I did not care for whose sake she did it. Only I really thought she was not quite well, and required rest. I thought she was more affected than usual at tea-time; and could have been angry with her nonsensical ways once or twice, but that I knew the real goodness of her heart. She said she wished she had the power to sweeten my life as she could my tea. I told her what a comfort she had been during my late time of anxiety; and then I stole out to try if I could hear the evening singing at the vicarage, by standing close to the garden-wall.

### CHAPTER XVIII

'The next morning I met Mr. Bullock by appointment to talk a little about the legacy which was paid into his hands. As I was leaving his office, feeling full of my riches, I met Miss Horsman. She smiled rather grimly, and said:

'"Oh, Mr. Harrison, I must congratulate you, I believe. I don't know whether I ought to have known, but as I do, I must wish you joy. A very nice little sum, too. I always said you would have money."

'So she had found out my legacy, had she? Well, it was no secret, and one likes the reputation of being a person of property. Accordingly I smiled, and said I was much obliged to her; and, if I could alter the figures to my liking, she might congratulate me still more.

'She said, "Oh, Mr. Harrison, you can't have everything. It would be better the other way, certainly. Money is the great thing, as you've found out. The relation died most opportunely, I must say."

'"He was no relative," said I; "only an intimate friend."

'"Dear-ah-me! I thought it bad been a brother! Well, at any rate, the legacy is safe."

'I wished her good morning, and passed on. Before long I was sent for to Miss Tomkinson's.

'Miss Tomkinson sat in severe state to receive me. I went in with an air of ease, because I always felt so uncomfortable.

'"Is this true that I bear?" asked she, in an inquisitorial manner.

'I thought she alluded to my five hundred pounds; so I smiled, and said that I believed it was.

'"Can money be so great an object with you, Mr. Harrison?" she asked again.

'"I said I had never cared much for money, except as an assistance to any plan of settling in life; and then, as I did not like her severe way of treating the subject, I said that I hoped every one was well; though of course I expected some one was ill, or I should not have been sent for.

'Miss Tomkinson looked very grave and sad. Then she answered: "Caroline is very poorly - the old palpitations at the heart; but of course that is nothing to you.".

'I said I was sorry. She had a weakness there, I knew. Could I see her? I might be able to order something for her.

'I thought I heard Miss Tomkinson say something in a low voice about my being a heartless deceiver. Then she spoke up. "I was always distrustful of you, Mr. Harrison. I never liked your looks. I begged Caroline again and again not to confide in you. I foresaw how it would end. And now I fear her precious life will be a sacrifice."

'I begged her not to distress herself, for in all probability there was very little the matter with her sister. Might I see her?

'"No!" she said shortly, standing up as if to dismiss me. "There has been too much of this seeing and calling. By my consent, you shall never see her again."

'I bowed. I was annoyed, of course. Such a dismissal might injure my practice just when I was most anxious to increase it.

'"Have you no apology, no excuse to offer?"

'I said I had done my best; I did not feel that there was any reason to offer ail apology. I wished her good morning. Suddenly she came forwards,

'"Oh, Mr. Harrison," said she, "if you have really loved Caroline, do not let a little paltry money make you desert her for another."

'I was struck dumb. Loved Miss Caroline! I loved Miss Tomkinson a great deal better, and yet I disliked her. She went on:

'"I have saved nearly three thousand pounds. If you think you are too poor to marry without money, I will give it all to Caroline. I am strong, and can go on working; but she is weak, and this disappointment will kill her." She sat down suddenly, and covered her face with her hands. Then she looked up.

'"You are unwilling, I see. Don't suppose I would have urged you if it had been for myself; but she has had so much sorrow." And now she fairly cried aloud. I tried to explain; but she would not listen, but kept saying, "Leave the house, sir! leave the house!" But I would be heard.

'"I have never had any feeling warmer than respect for Miss Caroline, and I have never shown any different feeling. I never for an instant thought of making her my wife, and she has had no cause in my behaviour to imagine I entertained any such intention."

'"This is adding insult to injury," said she. "Leave the house, sir, this instant!"

### CHAPTER XIX

'I went, and sadly enough. In a small town such an occurrence is sure to be talked about, and to make a great deal of mischief. When I went home to dinner I was so full of it, and foresaw so clearly that I should need some advocate soon to set the case in its right light, that I determined on making a confidante of good Mrs. Rose. I could not eat. She watched rite tenderly, and sighed when she saw my want of appetite.

'"I am sure you have something on Your mind, Mr. Harrison. Would it be - would it not be - a relief to impart it to some sympathising friend?"

'It was just what I wanted to do.

'"My dear, kind Mrs. Rose", said I, "I must tell you, if you will listen."

'She took up the fire-screen, and held it, as yesterday, between me and her.

'"The most unfortunate misunderstanding has taken place. Miss Tomkinson thinks that I have been paying attentions to Miss Caroline; when, in fact - may I tell you, Mrs. Rose? - my affections are placed elsewhere. Perhaps you have found it out already?" for indeed I thought I had been too much in love to conceal my attachment to Sophy from any one who knew my movements as well as Mrs. Rose.

'She hung down her head, and said she believed she had found out my secret.

'"Then only think how miserably I am situated. If I have any hope - oh, Mrs. Rose, do you think I have any hope - "

'She put the hand-screen still more before her face, and after some hesitation she said she thought, "If I persevered - in time - I might have hope." And then she suddenly got up, and left the room.
