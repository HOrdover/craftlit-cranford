- 00:00 Episode 680
- 02:40 [ME/CFS info](https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2025/02/17/long-covid-muscle-study-dissent/): Listen to “The Blog” (4 min vs 19 min on “The Gist—yes, he titled them in reverse). This is one of the Long-Covid papers we’ve been waiting for. PEM—post-exertional malaise is “feeling tired/sore a day after a workout” on crack. 
- PEM pain and brain fog can last up to two weeks after exertion…The Rank Study he mentions is the group saying “duh m’dude. If you’ve been in bed for a year yer gonna be tired after a workouta. You gotta get back on your exercise routine and qitcherbellyaching” —a theory that’s led to permanent patient paralysis. 
	- The other study is big bc it indicates that the damage is mitochondrial, not systematic (i.e., we’re getting plenty of blood to our muscles. The muscles just can’t do anything WITH that oxygen)  
	- —and [podcast episode](https://pca.st/episode/c1e74b1c-7626-4b89-bce4-a8d312355370) from the People who created the Visible app that has saved my life (MakeVisible.com)

## BOOK TALK—Re-hash Notes

## Pre-hash Notes

- 06:13 BOOK TALK BEGINS__
- 06:40 - Re-hash Ch 1
- 09:35 - Humor and Gaskell
- 10:40 - Plum Deluxe Bookshop Blend White **(get link) PLUM DELUX PROMO CODE** - put on screen and I'll have to give you a tiny audio clip of that promo code to insert for this episode - SORRY! We just got this deal. I'll give you a longer clip to use in 681. Put a still of their website on screen—makes it easier, right?
- 11:20 - who's the narrator?!
- 12:26 - Bakehouses
- 14:20 - Flints haberdashery in London (real place)
- 15:15 - Biblical DebORah (the pronunciation that should be used *ahem*) read about her in Judges, 4:4
- 15:36 - "Strong minded" women - yeah, that was an insult. Kinda like "She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted..." when Elizabeth Warren tried to read a letter from Coretta Scott King into the Congressional Record in February 2017. See Mary Wollstonecraft on masculine women on [CraftLit's Weekly Constitutional playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObwB926r7yOMwDRTPgxXFlTYjZuWRnx8)
 - 17:50 - [Sampler from Irish museum](https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Collections-Research/Collection/Documentation-Discoveries/Artefact/A-Nineteenth-Century-Sampler/2cfb695b-f8db-479c-a637-62079a3d20b9) - this is not the one I remembered (they haven't digitised their entire collection) but it DOES have a shocking poem in it—by a 14 year old girl.
 - ==**18:40 POSSIBLE SHORT CLIP - Start with the sample and literacy of girl vs Dad, trim as needed in middle, End with "Don't Bogart my Equal Rights"**==
 - 18:50 - Just a headsup: Gaskell sort of doesn't really quote things accurately—at this time code she's sort of quoting Hamlet, she also makes up words like *Brunonian*
 - 20:02 - sort of quoting Alexander Pope "Imitations of Horace" 1733
 - 20:17 - sort of quoting/sub-referencing Spenser's "The Faerie Queene" IV:3;32, 1596
 - 20:55 - Nasty cruel Railroads. yup.
 - 22:17 - the guy who got a railroad spike through his head - Phineas Gage ([podcast dispelling myths with SCIENCE!](https://www.sciencehistory.org/stories/disappearing-pod/everything-you-know-about-phineas-gage-is-wrong/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ==erik can you put Phineas Gage's name on screen? Since I couldn't recall it, also the dust ruffle cap pic around 23:50, and the paper's name at 24:50 ==
 - 23:13 - Bonnet as helmet 
 - In fashion in 1820. ***Not*** in fashion by the 1840s:
