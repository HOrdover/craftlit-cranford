At one of our last book club nights, the larger discussion of podcast and YouTuber sustainability and advertising came up and I shared the long-concealed story of how way back in the day, like‚Ä¶ten years ago, I received a NSFW sponsorship for the podcast. Specifically, um. Toys. Adult toys. I had a good think with myself over that one‚ÄîI‚Äôm not anti-toy‚Äîbut to this day I cannot figure out what it was about Craftlit that brought me that sponsorship offer - I mean, KIDS LISTEN TO THE SHOW. These are the the kinds of BTS gems that drop every so often on our Book and Watch Parties that happen the last Thursday night of every month, 8pm Eastern US time. This month, July 31st 2025, we‚Äôll be watching *The Princess Bride* film together (we read it last month). Please feel free to join us as we knit/doodle/crochet/sketch/and sidebar-chat our way through the film. I promise there will be no NSFW sponsorships that night‚Äîbut I can NOT promise there won‚Äôt be stories... Link to join is in the captions." REEL 2: Here‚Äôs something we learned last month for CraftLit‚Äôs monthly book party the last Thursday of every even-month: Book and Screenwriter William Goldman actually improved The Book by writing the movie script the way he did. There are entire sections of dialogue that he lifts from the book and puts in the movie. It is one of the best‚Äîif not *the* best‚Äîbook-to-film adaptation that has been made. Here's a few scenes that are straight from the book and executed perfectly: [insert 3 different scenes, with images/screenshots of the dialogue in the book itself. I have an idea how this can be edited, I'll send to Erik/Aldrin when you're done recording] And SO much more. And we can watch this movie together. This month‚Äôs watch party for The Princess Bride will be on July 31, 2025. Just join through the link in the captions. And if you don't that would be simply- [For editors. Cut to Vizzini yelling "Inconceivable!"] REEL 3: (Super short. Fun video!) For this one, I recommend filming this on your cellphone. It can be like this where you're walking around somewhere: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zyVWPHQ3NQ-f6C2nHRCwxsJiWKemTNAq/view?usp=drive_link Or like this where you start the video by setting the phone down and just talking. (This is called a visual hook!) https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMAtGMTs3Kh "Okay, at last months CraftLit book party for William Gold‚Äômans ‚ÄúThe Princess Bride‚Äù We found the one person‚Äîperhps the ONLY person on the planet‚Äîwho did NOT like Robin Wright as Princess Buttercup. To be kind to all parties involved, we will not be releasing their name. What I want to know is: AT THE TIME, who would have been a better Buttercup in The Princess Bride? Let me know."
