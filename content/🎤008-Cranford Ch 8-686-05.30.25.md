# Characters in *Cranford* (Updated for Chs. 6‚Äì8)

![[Cranford Character Sheet chs 1-8.png]]
   
- 18:25 - County families‚Äîthe landed gentry in the county - you know‚Ä¶the only important people in the area :( 
- Miss Pole ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think of something to say back to her‚Ä¶ tonight‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äînothing changes HA!
- 18:40 Peerage - prob refers to Burke‚Äôs Peerage and Baronetage (first pub was 1826!!!) Only 16 Scottish peers were SELECTED to sit in the House of Lords; 19:00 -comparison to Job - God takes everything from him then torments him some more.
- 20:40 - The Arley‚Äôs  - we learned that Lady Arley shopped at Betty Barker‚Äôs milliner shop last week and was part of why the shop eventually only served the well-to-do of Cranford ‚Äî‚Äîwhich lets us know that there WAS a well-to-do set and our ladies are not they! 
- 22:00 - Fourth at pool - another card game 
- 22:45 - Sedulously-Dedication, diligence
- 22:55 - ‚Äúthought you might want a description of Mrs Smith, Her being a bride‚Äù. B/c often a bride‚Äôs 1st appearance in society after honeymoon she wore her dress.
- 23:15 - ***nipped up her petticoats*** - 
- 25:10 - Mr Milliner - introduce him to listeners - ignored back door (GASP)
- 25:15 - candle lighters as an excise LOL ALSO what‚Äôs she making them out of?!??? - EXCELLENT WAY TO USE OLD BILLS & LETTERS!
- assumption no one will go LOL - 
- ***Poole‚Äôs rationalization to go to party ü§£ - don‚Äôt give her the satisfaction of hurting us (but mostly I HAVE A NEW CAP!!!)***
- 27:23 - Phlegmatic  - Mrs Jamieson - of the Four Temperaments: sanguine, choleric, melancholic, and phlegmatic - UNemotional
- Very smart cap  - Miss Pole - 
- Duty was to FIRST buy a new cap - everyone does b/c 
- when wearing a new cap, ***Cranford ladies were like Ostriches and didn‚Äôt care what was on their bodies -  lol -*** 
- 28:00 - Brooches - popular now??
	- Dogs eyes - 
	- Hair insides - Mausoleum/weeping willow
	- Stiff muslin - like brooch mounted on florettes
	- We‚Äôre brooches out of fashion??!? - 
- LISTEN to description of Miss Pole! HA!
	- Scotch pebbles - not really timely. Victoria bought Balmoral in 1848 and suddenly Scottish agates (found in stream beds with other semi-precious stones) were VERY popular
	- 30:00 ==HEATHER-GEMS== LINK and picture
- 30:45 - Hair powder Over his coat collar - started in 1715 and was WAY out of date by now 
- *St James‚Äô Chronicle* is a 4-way shared subscription with Cranford ladies - Quarter share -

- 32:12 - pembrook table - drop-leaf table
- 32:45 - Kaleidoscope - invented in 1817 by Sir David Brewster; Conversation Cards and Puzzle Cards - seen in the Doctor sub-plot of the Mini-series/‚ÄúMr Harrisson‚Äôs Confessions (1851)
- 34:30 - Drawings on tea chests - Might be Tole painting? might be like [this (which happens to be ***japanned!*** A tinplate tea chest, c. 1760, painted with naturalistic flowers and containing two tinplate tea canisters and a sugar box. Private collection)](https://antique-collecting.co.uk/2022/07/28/tea-chests-and-caddies-the-essential-guide/)
- ![[IMG_1508.jpeg]]
- 36:35 - torpid - mentally OR physically inactive
- Agreeable and not formally - seated
- 36:40 - 10¬£ - would have purchased her whole ensemble - see below
- A Lord, yet NOT a ***Lord*** - had become a common turn of phrase (A __- but not A ____), kind of like ‚Äúbecause Reasons‚Äù has become shorthand in conversation.  
- Lady Glenmire and Mrs. Jaimeson - SIL
- 41:05 - Small lumps of sugar - b/c sugar was lumped in-house, not purchased in pre-squared form
- Preference, Ombr√©, Quadrille, ***Basto***, Spadille - card games and Basto=Ace of Clubs is 3rd highest trump card in Ober and Quadrille. By playing it, Misss Pole makes Lady GLenmire use up the highest trump spadrille - the Ace of Spades
- 41:50 - Mrs Forrester‚Äôs (of Cow fame) LACE STORY!
- 43:00 - Catholic Emancipation Bill = 1829 gave Catholics access to certain public offices from which they had previously been barred. This would have exactly ZERO impact on the making of Brussels Lace. GET LEANNE TO TALK
- 42:30 - Emetic + top-boot *(in the early 1800s, Wellingtons were sometimes referred to as "top boots".¬†42:50 - The term "top boots" was used for high-cut boots, often associated with riding or military wear, and Wellingtons were a popular type of boot in that category)* - emetic causes vomiting (NOT as done in the mini-series)
- 43:30 - astronomy/astrology - Francis Moor‚Äôs astrological predictions
-
