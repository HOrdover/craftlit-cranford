Here are the patterns for the raffle/give away. I also have a free Book Tracker quilt pattern that people might be interested in. It's also an FPP pattern and can be found here: [https://www.snugglepuzzle.com/book-tracker-quilt/](https://www.snugglepuzzle.com/book-tracker-quilt/) It would be a great first pattern for people who haven't tried FPP before. Thanks again for all you do!

Tea’s Marketing and Domestic Image Advertisements and writings from the 1840s–1860s often emphasized tea as a wholesome, “domestic delight”—a key feature of middle‑class Victorian life: - A popular 1840s ad poem (“A Fireside Chat”, published at Edward Bell’s Tea Warehouse) described the scene as “snug,” with “kitten, kettle, husband, child and wife” all cozy around teatime—suggesting tea was an integral part of family harmony. - Horniman’s Pure Tea (circa 1863) explicitly touted itself as “pure” and sold only in packet form, reflecting consumer fears of adulteration and reinforcing an image of safety and quality . Although these ads are slightly later, the trend of promoting tea as wholesome, clean, and suitable for domestic display was already firmly established by 1850. 2. Green Tea Was Still Accentuated as Special Through the late 18th and early 19th centuries, green tea remained a prized variety, prized for fine Chinese imports like Hyson, Imperial, and congou: - A tea‑culture guide from 1730 noted green tea grades and valued the delicacy of Hyson and “Imperial” green leaf . - While by 1850 black tea was rising in popularity, green tea remained part of the common repertoire, especially among those seeking quality or health‑conscious options (). Hence, even in Cranford’s time, green tea would have been familiar—and likely regarded as “refined.” 3. Tea as Ritual—and the Role of Green Tea Tea in Victorian England had become more than a drink; it was a ritual and a sign of respectability: - Social guides and household manuals from the mid-19th century stressed the significance of regimented teatimes, elegant tablewares like caddies and fine china, and the etiquette around service . - Even though black tea was more widespread, green tea retained a niche position in such ritualistic presentations for its perceived elegance. 🧭 Conclusion - By 1850, green tea was: 1. Commonly available in Cheshire and other market towns. 2. Marketed as a pure, fine-quality product in the same vein as black tea but often associated with refinement. 3. Part of domestic tea rituals, stored in caddies and served with care in genteel households. Although specific mid‑1850s ads for green tea are rarer, the period’s focus on purity (to ward off adulteration) and ritual highlights how green tea would have been understood and consumed at the time.
