- I just listened to the podcast [Haptic and Hue: Tales of Textiles](https://pca.st/episode/81cf4576-9a83-4405-8f07-6a2cd8d9e32f). the June 4 episode is on The Witches of Scotland: How a Nesw Tartan Became a Living Memorial - and thought Craftlit people would be interested. Its about 2 women in Scotland, a professor and a lawyer, who studied an appalling episode in Scottish history, which lasted 173 years, where a law and the culture encouraged acusing and often executing people for being witches. They were mostly women, and evidently - although this was happening elsewhere in Europe and the colonies in America - Scotland executed a higher number of women than elsewhere.  The women wanted to come up with a memorial, and they have created a tartan, which is being crowd funded.  Anyway it was fascinating and it seemed right up our alley here.â€”**from JayKay**

PORTER SISTERS email/book

## Pre-hash Notes
moving chess pieces chapter
- "passage in dickens" ch 32 of Pickwick
- "veiled prophet in Lalla Rookh" by Thomas Moore (not that one, one that lived 1799-1852), verse tales joined by prose text, first tale "The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan" where the beautiful Zelica is lured to a harem & later killed by mistake by her lover...
- Rowland's Kalydor: a skin tonic with a basis of almond oil.
- Peruvian bonds: Bonds are issued by governments or companies, wishing to raise money. The implication of the name of our mid country in South America is that these bonds are risky, a kind of [South Sea bubble](https://youtu.be/k1kndKWJKB8?si=MOMsj302YiQ4RXbK).
- "understanding...coarse word" â€” "coarse" when talking about an engagement, I guess?
- "Bread and cheese and beer"
- "Tibbie Fowler...til her"
- "I put in my wonder"â€” means I spoke up about what I was wondering
- "her Order"
- "an audible as well as visual sign"
- "Queen of Spain's Legs"

It's also an FPP pattern and can be found here:Â [https://www.snugglepuzzle.com/book-tracker-quilt/](https://www.snugglepuzzle.com/book-tracker-quilt/)Â It would be a great first pattern for people who haven't tried FPP before.
