### ==B-Block-BOOK TALK—Re-hash Notes==
Picnic, Put-upon Mr Harrison, Foreshadowing (Walter)

#### Pre-hash Notes
- End of last arc, 
- new arc starts, 
- difference b/t short story and novella
Here’s the rough breakdown used by most literary scholars, publishers, and prize committees:

- **Short story**: under ~7,500 words (some stretch the upper end to 10,000–20,000 words).
- **Novelette** (less commonly used now): ~7,500–20,000 words.
- **Novella**: ~20,000–50,000 words.
- **Novel**: 50,000+ words.
    When _Mr. Harrison’s Confessions_ appeared in 1851 in _The Ladies’ Companion and Monthly Magazine_, it was serialized over several issues—common for works too long for a magazine short story but not long enough for a three-volume novel. This “middle length” is exactly what we now call a **novella**.
_Mr. Harrison’s Confessions_ runs around **35,000–40,000 words**, depending on the edition—right in the middle of the novella range.



### ==C-Block Book Audio / D-Block-Post-chapter Notes==
- Gaskell knew from dying children, shame we don't read more of these old books b/c vaxx-preventable deaths might be more recognized
- HORRIBLE NURSE blaming Sophie
	- Sophie had to be an adult from a young age - she speaks to Mary Wollstonecraft's points about women's educational restrictions being BS b/c women had to take on running the home which (if done right) was no less heavy than what the men did at work. Part of how we got here in this mess - only valuing $
- Mrs Rose and her hair dye
	- [Bernadette Banner depilatory video](https://youtu.be/xTj3hDJYHs0?si=_W0ExHyMSmhfDF-1)
	- him teasing her presets his friend Jack Marchand's description of his jokey youth
	- Paper Game
