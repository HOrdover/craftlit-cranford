## B-Block Book Talk—Re-hash Notes
Very Sad ch 13 - ended with Matty thtinking about martha. :( 

## Pre-hash Notes
- Rubric- The Book of Common prayer printed directions for teh service in red. Hens the Rubric (from the Latin word for ‘Red”) signified someting of importance and later came to mean “injunction” or general rule. REALLY??? LATIN FOR RED????
- Some surprisingly poetic text about maling a letter to a very far-away place.
- struck for wages: went on strike to get higher pay
- Mammon - Matthew 6:24, Devil of Covetovness or Demon of Greed (medieval and Milton - lowercase) (in hebrew meant money, modern hebrew. = wealth), , unjust worldly gain -  ANNOTATION is partly WRONG, But there WAS a Syrian God of Wealth
- akimbo - get definition
- A really lovely Martha section 
- AAah Voo DEER-ray zhuh *[Ah! Vous dirai-je, Maman](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Ah%21_vous_dirai-je_maman.jpg)* - Basically Twinkle Twinkle Little Start - the easiest piece of music one could learn to play. Mozart had done one of his 12 variations (though I’m partial to Tom Lehrer’s [Clementine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dehXq6a1sJU)) ![[Pasted image 20250707100236.jpg]]
- She could “trace out patterns very nicely for Muslin Embroidery, by dint of placing a piece of silver-paper over the design to be copied, and holding both against the window-pane, while she marked the scollop and eyelet-holes”. ANNOTATION SAYS “Probbably broderie anglaise which used scalloped edges and a pattern of holes sewn round with thread like a button-hole.“
- Use of globes in ladies seminary - obv finishing school, but why globeS plural? Terrestrial globe to learn geography and a Celestial Globe to learn simple astronomy/constellations  https://fi.edu/en/science-and-education/collection/celestial-globe ![[Pasted image 20250707100335.jpg]]
- [Wool-work and counting threads](https://www.wcfta.com/berlin-wool-work/) - think of needlepoint and petit-point, but you have to COUNT THE THREADS in a muslin or light canvas backing. Around 1830 v popular to stitch portraits of royalty (again, at least 10 years out of popularity elsewhere, but still popular in Cranford). Printed, gridded patterrns ([Beeton’s Book of Needlework](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15147/15147-h/15147-h.htm#image_592)) GET LINK WITH hashtag to Berlin Work!
- Getting through a Genealogical Chapter - all the ***begats*** in the Bible
- Under a glass shade - put a glass dome or CLOCHE over things to keep dust off—would have been REALLY important b/c it was DUSTY back then and only got worse in London as the Century went on (also used in gerdening for heat retention)

- East India Tea Company - Founded in 1600 by QE1 and held the chartered right to trade with India and China and IMPORT the tea  as a monopoly until 1834 (BTW, Twining’s started as a coffee SHOP/Room adding tea in 1717 , bought adjacent building for ladies to take tea(might be Western world‘s oldest dry tea and coffee shop) at No. 216 Strand london in 1706; still operating today -  and logo created in 1787 is worlds oldest in continuous use) B/c the EIC’s charter was for trade/importing, anyone could SELL the tea.
- an-axing me - annexing me
- our mites: Biblical times a mite was the lowest denomination of coin in Judea (two mites = one lepta (thin or small in Greek) which was equivalent to a quadran, the smallest Roman coin), (also see [Mark 12:43](https://bible.org/sites/bible.org/resources/netbible/index.htm?mar12.htm) re: the Widow’s Mite where Christ praises the window who gives her last two mites in the temple) Two mites were worth about 1/64th of a denari - a day’s wage for a common worker, toay about 1/8 of a US penny (1 cent)
- Another Account-book = Gods
- Spills - QUILLING (thank you Aimee!) video of [making Quilled spills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv833gm4WBI) 
- Comfit - nut, seed, etc covered in sugar coating - link to max miller’s video on [Sugar Plums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Nk0evkBpE&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD)
## C-Block Book Audio 

## D-Block Post-chapter Notes
- Martha’s wisdom on “listen to reason” - that “always means what someone else has got to say”
	- Love her “I’m glad you started with “well” - If you’d started with “But” like you did before I wouldn’t have listened.” ;)
- Super Important distinction is Miss Matty’s education FIFTY YEARS AGO - Vindication comes in here.
- I loved that Miss Matty doesn’t change her handwriting when writing to more eminent correspondents, but changes her SPELLING to more “creative” options the more prestigious the recipient.
- Drama b/t Lady Glenmire and Mrs Jamieson!
- Mrs Fitz-Adam not wanting to give too much to shame Miss Matty
- Matty preferring privation to exertion ;)
