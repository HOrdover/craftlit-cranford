- Listener Margaret had JUST read this book on the Porter Sisters when their books were mentioned in Cranford! ZEITGEIST!!!! Who Were the Porter Sisters? - SISTER NOVELISTS https://www.sisternovelists.com/who-were-the-porter-sisters.htmlhttps://www.sisternovelists.com/who-were-the-porter-sisters.html
- I just listened to the podcast [Haptic and Hue: Tales of Textiles](https://pca.st/episode/81cf4576-9a83-4405-8f07-6a2cd8d9e32f). the June 4 episode is on The Witches of Scotland: How a Nesw Tartan Became a Living Memorial - and thought Craftlit people would be interested. Its about 2 women in Scotland, a professor and a lawyer, who studied an appalling episode in Scottish history, which lasted 173 years, where a law and the culture encouraged acusing and often executing people for being witches. They were mostly women, and evidently - although this was happening elsewhere in Europe and the colonies in America - Scotland executed a higher number of women than elsewhere.  The women wanted to come up with a memorial, and they have created a tartan, which is being crowd funded.  Anyway it was fascinating and it seemed right up our alley here.—**from JayKay**

## B-Block-BOOK TALK—Re-hash Notes
ch 11 Samuel Brown - chess denoument chapter
PORTER SISTERS email/book

## Pre-hash Notes
moving chess pieces chapter
- "passage in dickens" ch 32 of Pickwick
- "veiled prophet in Lalla Rookh" by Thomas Moore (not that one, one that lived 1799-1852), verse tales joined by prose text, first tale "The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan" where the beautiful Zelica is lured to a harem & later killed by mistake by her lover...
- Rowland's Kalydor: a skin tonic with a basis of almond oil.
- Peruvian bonds: Bonds are issued by governments or companies, wishing to raise money. The implication of the name of our mid country in South America is that these bonds are risky, a kind of [South Sea bubble](https://youtu.be/k1kndKWJKB8?si=MOMsj302YiQ4RXbK).
- "understanding...coarse word" — "coarse" when talking about an engagement, I guess?
- "Bread and cheese and beer"--this is the preferred meal of Dr. Gibson in Gaskells wives and daughters 1866, but it is frowned upon by his GenTeal wife when he tells her that bread and cheese is the chief of my diet she responds. I really cannot allow cheese to come beyond the kitchen, really, Mr. Gibson, it is astonishing to compare your appearance and manners with your taste. You look like such a gentleman.
- "Tibbie Fowler...til her"t--poem by Robert burns, 1756 to 1796 in which to be Fowler is besieged by many suitors it is only at the end of the ballad that it is made clear that her money is the attraction
- "I put in my wonder"— means I spoke up about what I was wondering
- "her Order"--referring to Lady Hirank, to which you suppose is herself to belong as a Terrell. Of course, there's no proof that she actually feels  
- "Queen of Spain's Legs"--The legs are nonexistent an illusion to a story, probably apocryphal about the future bride of a king of Spain, roundabout, the 16th century. Traveling through Spain to meet her husband to be, she reached the town, famous for stocking, making, and was presented with a very expensive pair. This was regarded by courtiers as a breach of decorum, which required close to conceal the legs. When courtier is said to have remarked, as the gift was refused, the queen of Spain has no legs.
