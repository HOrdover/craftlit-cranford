I have been using the song "Matthew Shell_Love Part Two (Original Mix).mp3" as exit music for my free podcast back on September 22, 2007, episode 71. Mr. Shell is given credit on that episode (http://craftlit.com/71-2/). I downloaded it from a PodSafe audio site at that time where the artist placed it for podcaster use. 
I contacted Mr. Shell several years ago to confirm that I have the rights to use this song. He agreed and gave me license permission. I have a screenshot of that conversation should you need it.
I continue to use (and attribute) the audio under the original (18-year-old) agreement.
Thank you,
