draft of letter to Plum Deluxe Tea:

**Subject:** A Special Collaboration Between CraftLit & Plum Deluxe Tea

\

Dear \[Name\],

\

I hope this email finds you well! It’s been wonderful watching Plum Deluxe grow over the past decade—I still remember when we first worked together in those early days. It’s been inspiring to see how your dedication to quality and community has flourished, and I’d love to explore a new collaboration that celebrates both of our audiences.

\

As you may know, *CraftLit* has continued to thrive as a space where literature lovers gather to enjoy classic books—always with a comforting cup of tea in hand. Given our shared appreciation for mindful moments and meaningful conversations, I’d love for *CraftLit* to become the **official podcast of Plum Deluxe Teas**.

\

Rather than a traditional sponsorship, I envision this as a mutual partnership:

• Each episode, I’d feature a Plum Deluxe tea—sharing my selection and how it enhances the reading experience.

• I’d encourage my audience to discover your blends, weaving them into the cozy storytelling and literary discussions that define *CraftLit*.

• In return, we could cross-promote our brands—introducing more tea lovers to *CraftLit* and more book lovers to Plum Deluxe.

\

This would be a natural and organic way to spread the word about both our communities while offering listeners an enhanced, immersive experience. I’d love to hear your thoughts on how we might shape this collaboration together.

\

Looking forward to catching up and exploring the possibilities!

\

Warmly,

\[Your Name\]
